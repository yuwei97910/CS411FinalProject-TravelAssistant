We love sushi and this is the only place that has ever gotten us to not order it and instead only get the special things on the menu. THATs how good it all is. The brothers have crafted the simplest, most delicious bites that its a waste to order anything else.',2);

But for real...its for good reason. Quite easily one of the top 10 restaurants Ive ever eaten at. So great that we went twice in one month.My one and only recommendation is to order the Omakase. Let the chef(s) take full control because I promise you, you wont regret it. My fiancé who has become more of an adventurous eater over the years has zero complaints! That means nothing to you, but hes a total seafood scaredy-cat. The first time we came, I only ordered the Omakase and he ordered off of the menu. By the time the second dish was served, he was regretting his decision. The Omakase menu truly pushes you to try what might normally be outside of your comfort zone. For me, that was the quail egg. The perfect shooter with a mix of savory, citrusy, and spicy. Excuse me if I dont have an exactly refined palette, but thats what stood out to me and made it delicious. I was also very pleasantly surprised that they managed to make the textures not weird. With all the uniqueness offered, its priced VERY fairly - especially for Chicago at $80 & up per person. And when I say every single item is a favorite, I mean it. Im sitting here trying to point out the phenomenal angry crab, or the toro that just melts in your mouth, or even the fiesta maki but its just not fair to single any one item out! Go see for yourself.The second best part thats basically tied with the amazingly incredible food is the service. The staff has truly mastered their craft when it comes to timing of the food - especially when not everyone ordered the Omakase. Dont worry, my fiancé only made that mistake once. Theyre also all very knowledgeable of the menu, and for me, that makes a huge difference. They do so well in their role, they sold us on anchovy ice cream. Yes, anchovies. It was the most unique and flavorful dessert weve all ever had. Its even preferred by the chocolate lovers at the table. Think smores!Long story short, come with an open mind and enjoy the quality and perfectly bite sized options on the Omakase menu. Trust the chef(s)! Theyre the pros for a reason.',3);

It really isnt far off from the 150-200 dollar omakase places. The fish is just as fresh and the nigiri is just as good. The only difference may be a few pieces of more expensive seasonal fish at other omakases. But I was very happy with my dinner here and felt that the meal was very worth the price.

My wife and I got Omakase to keep things simple. We just sat down by the bar area and let the chefs take care of our evening. Food was delicious as expected. I honestly cant remember the names of every dish but our fav is definitely the escolar (came out 3rd). The shooters were a bit too adventurous for me. I appreciated the different dimensions of flavors and texture that the chefs threw at us. By the time the sashimi came out, we were nearing stomach capacity. Portions were definitely enough. The entire dinner was an experience in itself. I highly recommend the Omakase! Really affordable too.',10);

The omakase menu is comprised of so many courses to fill you up. A handful of the courses even come with multiple items/bites. I was literally so stuffed that I could barely finish the sashimi selection towards the end. I was drawn here mainly because the chefs designed a menu with beautifully creative dishes intermixed with the more traditional nigiri pieces that you find in other omakases. The only thing missing for me was having the experience of watching the chef curate the dishes right in front of you. Getting omakase here doesnt guarantee a front row seat at the sushi bar, but I honestly cant complain because everything else was amazing!',50);

The quality of the fish was amazing and there were really unique flavors in each dish. Towards the end I started getting too full (and I can eat a lot, and was very hungry that day!) to really appreciate the last few courses - the last course is sashimi and its not small. Tips- We ordered an extra dish, a toro and uni special that you can make your own hand rolls with and it was really good, but if youre doing the omakase I would recommend not ordering anything extra to avoid the same mistake I made. - Some of the courses can also get pretty spicy with a good amount of wasabi - the fiesta maki especially was very spicy for me- The omakase is also pretty fast paced since its held strictly to the 90-minute limit so dont be late for your reservation!',32);

I went in with an idea of what I wanted to get based on everything Ive read! We decided to opt out of doing omakase and basically form our own ten course meal from the a la carte menu!We were seated at the sushi bar and kitchen area and got to see them making everything in front of us. Its always exciting to see the action! They have booths on both sides of the restaurant as well depending on what kind of experience you want. We got the oyster shooters, dynamite mussels, polenta bites, flaming tuna maki, orange rush, char siu skewer, spicy toro maki, wagyu nigiri, otoro sashimi and lava cake. Everything was so so good! My favorites were the oyster shooter, the spicy toro maki and the otoro (Im a sucker for a some food fatty tuna). Every single plate was so jam packed with flavor and everything melded so well together. The fish was so fresh and melt in your mouth. The lava cake was the perfect finishing touch. It had a warm moist chocolate cake topped with black sesame ice cream (love love love black sesame ice cream) Overall my expectations were definitely exceeded. Definitely not super affordable sushi, but I would say its more affordable than many *good* sushi places.

I wish they provided me a copy of the menu with the names because honestly at this point, I am just guessing what the items were exactly.The space is a bit small so make sure you make reservations far in advance. I think we made ours about a month out and there werent many good options for times, so we settled for a 530 pm which is a bit rushed to get to if you work until 5 pm.

The atmosphere was just right and what I was expecting - not as upscale as other Omakase experiences, but I like that about Kai Zan! We had a semi private seating area in the new extension of the restaurant. Semi secluded, and definitely felt safe dining here. Lets talk food. Highlights-Angry Crab generous amounts of crab and it was perfectly executed -Char Siu reminds me of how my parents like eating this (mmmmm drool). Tender, juicy, and flavorful -Sashimi 7 pieces, and this alone made the Omakase price fair.Meh -dynamite mussel is satiating, but the notes arent as delicate (probably because its a mussel) Fish are sourced from all over the globe, and it to have these flavors in Humboldt park is something else!',0);

You definitely need to make reservations for this place at least 2 weeks in advance if you dont want an odd dinner time. I got the regular omakase both time I came here and I was so full by the end. You do have the option of getting omakase individually if the other people in your party just want to order off the menu. The servers were super attentive and explained each of the courses that we got in the omakase. I have sat both at the bar and in a closed booth, and the bar definitely feels more intimate since you get to see your food being made in front of you. My favorite courses - Madai Carpaccio just super fresh fish, amazing taste and the olive oil really stands out - Tuna dashi I didnt expect soup to be incorporated but its such a nice break from all the rice and raw fish. Makes you feel all nice and warm - Sashimi platter So much fish wow just a great value- Occassionally the chefs will create something new and let you try it out, and we had this amazing kale and tuna(?) dish that was probably my favorite dish of the night. Will be back soon to try out the premium omakase!',0);

I kind of wish there was a better mix of both, but overall Im glad we tried this and everything was still very high quality. The quality products given were more uni, wagyu, high cuts of sashimi like fatty tuna.

The donburi with quail egg yolk, uni and ikura and of course the wagyu were my favorite courses. Staff was great, explaining each dish and sitting at the bar was exciting to see the chefs at work.

To note, this place books fast - I was looking close to two months prior and the earliest res I got for Friday was 845 pm. We arrived maybe 10 minutes earlier, and given their strict 1.5 hr allotments, we were seated close to our scheduled time. It is a little intense having to scarf down your omakase in that amount of time, often with dishes coming out on top of one another, if not at the same time, but to be fair, they at least are transparent about the timing at the forefront, so I guess that should be expected. I personally didnt mind as much, as it was an efficient use of my time.I really enjoyed the space - on the small side, but not too much. There were nice nooks of seating. We were seated at the chefs bar, which I enjoy, but the separate booths certainly are more intimate.Boo and I opted for a regular and premium omakase. Service overall was fantastic. We were regularly checked on and given a run down prior to each dish. All the staff were very friendly, waters were refilled and plates were consistently cleared. It was fun seeing the chefs in actions, and they certainly were very well organized and devoted to their work. It was nice that one of the brothers even asked how we were doing at one point.I thoroughly enjoyed both omakases. I do have to say while the premium is more creative with higher quality ingredients (A5 wagyu and the fattier cuts of fish), the overall value wasnt quite there and was only marginally better for me. The dishes could have been more memorable. I found for both, that similar notes were often used for various dishes - e.g. I thought the basil lemon microgreens enhanced one dish while not the other and I dont know if the consistent use of edible flowers were necessary, except for a nice IG shot. There was a deep fried prawn, noted to be completely edible with the shell, except that I found it not as easy to go down as the more common, soft shell crab. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the dishes, as they were tasty. We had two soups, and both the broths were clean and tasty. I also enjoyed the scallop dish and all the quality sashimi. Overall, I definitely enjoyed Kai Zan and would come back. Dont expect an authentic experience, as yes, you are on a time limit and the omakase is essentially pre-set (although they will cater to your needs). You def can be relieved that you at least wont have slow service here. Also, the chefs do fuse modern and traditional flavors here, so expect that and overall, good quality food.

We also added a few specials. Our 10+ course meal of small bites could not have been more delicious. By the end we wanted more, but mostly cause the food was so good.

The server asked us if we wanted their last appetizer. It was the DIY uni toro hand roll. That appetizer was to die for. If I were put on deaths row, that would be one of my top two dish I would eat before I get outed. The omakase also came with wagyu sliders, which melts in your mouth when you bite. There was a dish where the fish was smoked, so when you open the lid, a bunch of smoke came out and the smoke flavored the fish. I can go on forever, but this place is a must.

The regular Omakase is $65 for one person which is so affordable compared to omakases at other restaurants. One omakase is a lot of food! If you dont want to get 2 separate omakase, you can just order one and tell them that you want to share between 2 people for an extra $15 so that they can give you extra portions to share. This is what we did and this is what Id recommend you do as well if its your first time here! This gives you a chance to try out the omakase but also leave room to try out some other things on their menu if you want!I was a bit skeptical about the omakase because some of the items on the menu sounded a bit boring. But I was SO wrong. The flavors that they add to everything is amazing. My favorites was the ESCOLAR & MAGURO PEARLS. Both fish is lightly seared and the spicy mayo and truffle oil makes these so savory and so delicious.We also ordered some additional items* WAGYU BEEF NIGIRI - my first time trying wagyu beef and this was really good. it was seared and had such a strong beefy flavor but it had such a soft texture that it melted in your mouth* SEARED FATTY TUNA - I forget what kind of tuna cut it was but it was very fatty and melts in your mouth like butter! AMAZINGThe waiters did a good job at timing the dinner. They cleared out our plates when we finished, and within a few minutes, a new plate would come out.For Dessert we tried* LAVA CAKE w/ BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM - Like your typical lava cake but with black sesame ice cream. Great dessert but nothing out of the ordinary.* UBE MOCHI - get this!! This is not your typical mochi. They make this in house. The outer mochi shell has yuzu sauce infused into it to give this slighty tartiness to the ube ice cream. It is so good!',2);

Also, the salmon and the tuna of Sashimi was not that fresh too. It was too visible to notice that the tuna was just defrozen, and the salmon was just okay.

I also expected more from the main course but by the time that came out (course #6-7?), I was extremely full. The plate of sashimi came at the very end which was unfortunate because I had no more room in my stomach at this point. I managed to take a bite of each of the different pieces and as expected, everything was super fresh. The only downside to the experience was the time limit of 90 minutes.

Food is served to you in a super organized structure, and you wont experience a long gap or need to wait between two courses for sure.

I was a little bummed, but she did give us the option to add on uni for just a $5 upcharge. Id never had uni before, so of course I said, Sure, why not.And you guys. This. Was. Amazing. I wish I had a list of everything we ate, but instead I took pictures because thats the type of person I am. We started with a bunch of raw dishes. One of my favorites was a quartet of fatty tuna that really just melted in my mouth. The plating was simple and thoughtful. Im not a huge fan of oyster shooters, but the oyster/uni/scallop shooters that they had at Kai Zan tasted great and had a good kick. We got a plate of their Fiesta Roll which was probably the most boring part of the meal, really. The warm dishes were good (though tbh, we were already enthralled by the sushi).

Asked the waiter if those things were on the menu and he promptly brought out the omakase menu (this is a plus). I saw many things I wanted to try on the menu so I thought to myself,  why not!

Ive had the good and the bad. Came into Kai Zan honestly not expecting that great, but l was pleasantly surprised. There were 10 courses and more than one course had more than one piece of sushi in it. The pearls came with two of each. The main had four different pieces, etc. My favorites were probably the Angry Crab, Orange Crush, and the oyster shooter.  All full of flavor, creative, and pleasing to the eye. Wont say too much since its definitely something you have to experience for yourself.

We tried Potato Ohitashi this past visit for something different and it was SO good, plus a little more filling. For dessert, their green tea ice cream is very good (creamy, not very sweet) as are their mochis (love the Japanese pumpkin flavor they had during our most recent visit)My only complaint is the 1.5 hour time limit (we tend to make later reservations so we dont feel rushed), based on the space and the popularity, I understand why they do it; however, the one time we chose to do the Omakase I personally felt a bit rushed.

Every single one of them ensures that your experience is unforgettable.

Not only is every dish unique, well thought through and different from   other common sushi spots, but the QUALITY of the ingredients used is a huge difference maker. Melvin and Carlo will only serve you the highest quality of fish/seafood and if they are unable to source ingredients that meet their expectations, well then it wont be on the menu (specifically Uni).Personal favorites and must try listEscolar Pearls-I wish they offered a bottomless special of this dish, the first time I tried these I ordered them 3 times...stop judging me.Maguro Pearls-A close 2nd to the Escolar Pearls, absolutely incredible.Dynamite Mussels-Personally, I had a strong dislike of the texture of mussels my entire life, until the Chefs recommended I try them....theyre unlike any mussels youll ever have and an absolute must order-the flavor is mind blowing!Angry Crab-I recommend getting these as hand rolls (not on the menu), it is hands down the best hand roll you will ever eat in your entire life, dont take my word for it, try it and I guarantee you will order at least 2 during your meal.Uni Toro Tartare Special-If they have Uni, they will most likely offer this special. I recommend you order this because its unlike any dish you will ever eat anywhere else. You receive a beautifully presented dish with Uni, Toro, Pickled Wasabi and a Qual Egg on top (theres more in there...trust me) which you mix up and then create your own rolls of goodness with....this one is arguably my favorite dish all together, ever!Green Monster-This roll is presented beautifully, its a avocado wrapped roll that is second to none and extremely delicious!Polenta Bites-Another creation that is over the top. Its simple, but the flavor is HUGE!King Oyster Mushroom-Unlike any mushroom dish you will ever taste in your life. The consistency and flavor if this make it hard to believe youre eating a mushroom skewer!All of their shooters are amazing but the Uni Shooter is my favorite. The concept is actually not something I generally would enjoy but after having tried all of them I can now understand why they are so popular!I recommend always getting any and all specials they have, these are always the absolute BEST and AMAZING creations.

I figured I could call later and try and see what we could get. Maybe its more walk-in?First interaction with the restaurant was exceptional. I didnt catch her name but the young lady who spoke to me was polite, patient and so so so helpful. For some reason when a hostess is like this at a busy place, Im happily surprised. But impressed. She informed me they were booked solid, but just in case someone cancelled she took down my name, number and time of choice. 30 minutes later she called me with a cancellation and offered me the spot. I took it. Then a torrential downpour hit and getting home from work was impossible, let alone to dinner. 50 minutes of driving later (river north to west loop to Kaizan) we rolled in a little wet and super hungry, 20 minutes late.Regardless of our delay, the same young lady checked in on us via phone while we parked and gently let us know they had reservations after us. We promised we would be out and completely understood. She was kind and patient with us as we walked in, slightly soaked. We were seated at the bar, and boy am I happy we were.

This is my second time eating here and I enjoyed my experience thoroughly. The service here is very fast, probably because you only have a set amount of time to dine. For two people, I believe it is around ninety minutes to finish your meal before you have to leave.I ordered omakase both times I came here and noticed that a few menu items had changed. I was excited to see that this time, the orange rush was incorporated into the omakase menu. This was one of my favorite dishes that I had ordered a la carte the first time, but it added a hefty $10 to my bill. Overall, I thought the omakase menu allowed you to get a nice taste of many different items, however, not all of the dishes wowed me. My favorites were the escolar pearls and orange rush. Some misses for me were the oyster/scallop shooters (Im not a fan of shooters) and char siu (which was a bit too tough for me to enjoy). I also ordered the uni hand-roll (not on the omakase menu) which looked spectacular, but for $28 I felt that it was a bit underwhelming. The uni was very fresh, however, and was a nice touch.Make sure you save room for dessert! I almost think that the house-made desserts are better than the fish...! The green tea ice cream had an extremely strong green tea flavor which I loved. It did not taste artificial at all like many other green tea ice creams. The chocolate lava cake was pretty good as well and was a nice contrast to the ice cream.If you just order omakase, the bill ends up being a bit over $80 per person which is certainly not cheap. I think it is a reasonable price for what you get and it is less expensive than what you would pay for a tasting menu at some other restaurants. Omakase was good, but some of the dishes were misses for me simply because I was not a fan of the ingredients. If I came back in the future, I would definitely order a la carte so that I can get foods that are more suited for my taste.',4);

The oysters were refreshing and cleansed the mouth between the competing tastes of the other dishes. All of the fish nigiri were outstanding - the tuna and hamachi were smooth and silky, but the salmon belly rose above them both with its richness. I was a little disappointed with the wagyu beef, both when served on its own and as nigiri. The juices caramelized on the surface of the meat, providing a promising first bite, but the flavor held little longevity. The karaage was ordinary, despite the hope offered by the marinated chicken meat. The hamachi collar was the most popular dish among our table of four, though I preferred the salmon nigiri. It took little encouragement for the white fish to fall from its frame, and even less so for it to melt in the mouth. It was accompanied by a ponzu-scallion sauce and grated daikon radish which brought a welcome salty kick to the otherwise unassuming hamachi. The braised octopus - a special of the day - was lightly-charred and its toughness changed up the texture profile of the evening. We finished our meal with mango mochi, lava cake, and matcha creme brulee. Most dessert lovers could find satisfaction somewhere across the selection, and indeed this dessert skeptic enjoyed sampling all three.Setting & Atmosphere 4-5 starsWe were lucky enough to be seated at one of several large booths along the left wall of the restaurant. We had the utmost privacy - we neither saw nor were seen by other customers during our meal - but the chatter in the air reminded us there were plenty of other lucky souls enjoying their meals too.Drink 4 starsWe each took a beer, and were pleasantly surprised to find the Asahi offered was not the Super Dry but instead the Select amber lager.Service 5 starsI have nothing but compliments for our server, Brian. He knew the menu inside out, offering sensible alternatives where our first choices were unavailable. We ordered several off-menu items on his recommendation, including the show-stealing salmon belly nigiri. Service was attentive, comically so at one point when replacement chopsticks were provided within seconds of a pair falling to the floor.Value 4 starsThe a la carte menu varies in its value-for-money - the daily collar offers an entree-sized amount for cooked fish for ~$14, but you would need to spend 2-3X that on appetizers to feel full. You should go to Kai Zan expecting to spend well for some of the best raw fish in Chicago. With such an approach, the omakase at $65 a head looks outstanding value.Return YesI could return and eat exclusively fish, as the tuna, salmon, and hamachi were the freshest Ive tasted in Chicago. I would like to check out the chefs omakase too - while the chicken and beef play second fiddle to the fish here, they would still be upper quartile across Chicago restaurants.',4);

As much of a turn off the time limit is when you make the reservations, I did not feel at all pressured during the service. We did take a bit of time to make a decision, but our server was very patient with us. He walked us through the menu and elaborated on any questions I had along with making great suggestions. The pace was on point, however my ONLY critic is that from sitting at the bar and seeing how the kitchen flowed, what I noticed was the timing and preparation of the food. Some of the hot food was sitting there longer than I would have liked it because when I got my food expecting it to be hot, it was warm, if not almost cold. Of the hot food, only the soup and dynamite mussel were actually hot. Everything else minus the raw stuff were almost cold, which was a bit disappointing. The concept of clean and simple flavors is what I left with at this place. The tasting menu flowed from simple to variety and back to simple again. Nothing distracted your palette of the original flavors. As the tasting menu ends with a showcasing a selection of sashimi, I thought was genius because the menu took you on such an adventure, but made sure to remind you of the origin with the main ingredients of the night, fish. Just the concept of something as simple as fish can be created and paired with different things, but yet alone it can still be appreciated. To end this wonderful experience, we had a cup of green tea (FREE) and Cashew Panna Cotta. Not too sweet or heavy. Simple but yet so many textures and layers involved in just a little dessert. It was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday dinner! Cheers.',5);

I was a bit put off by the time we were given. I was thinking to myself is that considered dinner or a late lunch? But I really wanted to treat my bf to omakase for our 4 year anniversary so took it anyways. After all, its my fault to making the last minute reservation. We tried the chefs menu and premium menu. The chefs menu is $65 for 10 courses. The premium menu is double the price with the same number of courses, but not twice the quality. For some reason, they dont print out the premium menus either. I would stick to the chefs menu. Food was fresh and delicious; a great value for omakase style. Its easily one of the better Japanese restaurants in the city. My favorites were the escolar & maguro pearls (2nd) and fiesta maki (8th). On the premium menu, the most memorable items were the fresh wasabi where the wasabi is cut up in tiny chunks, and the dessert which was ice-cream with passion fruit pure and crumble. If Im paying $120 for a multi-course meal and stating the most memorable items being a condiment and ice-cream, I think its safe to conclude it just didnt blow me away. To sum up the experience, we were running 5 minutes late, and when I called to let them know, I was told we had 90 minutes to finish and we might not get seated if we dont get there soon. A friend of mine who went recently said she had 2 hours to eat, so its not the case everyday. Perhaps its just a Saturday thing since therere more diners so they have to be rigid in sticking to the schedule. The staff choreographed beautifully in bringing out the dishes and taking them away promptly, but we felt rushed. The bill was handed to us at 6pm sharp. They asked if I was celebrating a special occasion the day before when they called to confirm my reservation. I told them my anniversary. When dinner was done, we ordered a dessert (additional one outside of the omakase meals), but there was no effort put into decorating the dessert, and we ended up paying for it. Ill admit that Im used to restaurants now waving the cost of the dessert for special occasions or at lease decorating it, but either way, why ask me if Im celebrating anything if they dont plan on doing anything for the guests? We walked out a little after 6pm and it was still bright. It was the strangest feeling since thats normally when dinner starts. Warning make your reservations a month early for those coveted weekend dinner seats, or get stuck with a late lunch time like what I had.',9);

We were so full by the time the sashimi came that we couldnt fully enjoy it like we wouldve wanted. Honestly, we would have rather they taken out the cooked the main course if that meant we were slightlier hungrier and could savor our raw fish completely.

They totally can squeeze more outta customers for the quality but maybe because its further out from the city its lower priced.  I want to say there were 10 courses.  All of the courses were great, unique and great flavor, but we were really really fished out by then end. And for me, that means there was a lot of fish because seafood is my favorite food (see all other reviews of mine... youll get it). The last dish was a ton of sashimi (and it was fantastic), but by the time we got to dish 10 it was almost hard to eat all of it, which was a shame.  Every single dish was some sort of raw seafood, which is totally expected for a sushi restaurant.  However, many Omakase dinners weve gotten in the city have some variation (king crab soup, seafood dumpling, ramen), which I think we like a little bit more. I think they could benefit from doing less courses and just giving you bigger portions as well.  Overall the quality of the fish was stellar and everything tasted great, but just be prepared for a lot lot lot of raw fish.  You will have a great meal here though.',5);

DIY sushi FTW!Hamachi collar OMFG this was melt in your mouth food porn awesomeness! The meat was SO tender and buttery and paired well with the ponzu sauce that came on the side. Its a fairly medium sized collar with plenty of fish meat to pick off, so Im very glad that we got to try this. Its sold at market price, which was only about $14. Some places will charge more than that, so we were pretty happy that it wasnt incredibly expensive.Uni/Oyster Shooters First of all, the presentation is beautiful. The shooters come in a lovely martini shaped glass and you can see the uni (or oyster) in the ponzu sauce. And then on top, you see a gorgeous sprinkling of black tobiko (fish eggs), an egg porn worthy quail egg, and chopped scallions. Since the uni (or oyster) and quail egg is more on the slimy side as far as texture goes, its balanced out with the flavor pops of the black tobiko and the crunch of the scallions.

We were finally able to snag a table here for my birthday dinner. The area is pretty quiet and from the outside at night its a bit hard to find. I was told its small and no joke it is.  Our reservation was on a Saturday night at 8pm. Got there on time and only had to wait 4 minutes four our table. The restaurant gives you an option to either buy drinks from them or bring your own bottle for 12 dollars corkage fee. We opted to drink the wine we brought. The hubs was a bit reluctant to do the omakase thinking it might be too much food. The omakase was 10 dishes so like 2 from each section of the menu. Either way, I was dead set on doing the tasting. Needless to say he realized his wife is right. We ordered the regular omakase instead of the premium one. I believe the premium has uni and foie gras. We noticed the omakase was a popular option. It doesnt hurt it only costs 65 bucks. Much cheaper than other places would charge. Each dish was delicious! If youre a slow eater like me beware since the dishes come out fast! We were impressed by their efficiency. I couldve done without the Angry Crab. It just didnt stand out. The sashimi was like butter in your mouth. The red snapper carpaccio was a dish I would order 20 times over. We really enjoyed the oyster shooter and how the flavors complimented each other. All of the dishes were great just minus the angry crab. The service was wonderful and on point. We were lucky to sit in front of the kitchen allowing us to watch each dish come together. We did order the chocolate lava cake as our dessert. The black sesame ice cream blew us away. The flavor of the ice cream was just a tad sweet but had a great berry flavor as well. Skip the cake and just get the ice cream instead. Overall, my high expectations for Kai Zan was met. We are already planning to come back for the premium omakase.',5);

First, the presentation on all of these were amazing. Im not one to take photos of food, but I just had to because it was so beautiful. For the omakase, you can tell that each item on the list was placed purposefully, in terms of what does the chef want you to taste next? Its hard to pick a favorite because everything tasted incredible, but I would say that the shooter was definitely something unique and highly worth trying. I would also highly recommend the matcha creme brulee.But, I think what made the experience great for me was the waiter.

Ever since the first course, I have been making a mental list of all the people I must bring and tell about Kai Zan. Not to mention, wondering when exactly is too-soon of a return for myself?! On this particular visit to Chicago, my boyfriend chose Kai Zan as our first kick-off meal (& bless his soul for finding it). The small, intimate setting of Kai Zan was the cherry on top. Not too loud, not too many people. We decided on the omakase 10-course meal and it was the best decision ever. Priced at $60/person, not only was it worth every penny but also a steal if you ask me. A few of my favorites were the Escolar Pearls (spicy seared escolar with soy & truffle oil) and the uni shooter (uni and scallop in ponzu sauce with raw quail egg). I also liked that they ended our meal with an assorted sashimi plate. It was a nice, clean way to end the 10-course meal. More toward the bottom of my list would be the Madai Carpaccio, only because I felt that the pesto overpowered the dish. But there wasnt a single item we had that I did not like. There are too many dishes to go through individually, but check out my pictures! Each dish was perfectly unique in its own way. This is not your typical omakase meal and although I was nervous for the whole fusion thing, each dish left me in awe. It was interesting that they incorporated traditional items along with cooked items -- like our 7th dish which they called a main dish. Without doubt, I would highly recommend the omakase ... although Im sure everything on the menu is worth trying. Counting down until we meet again, Kai Zan.',7);

We have lived in Chicago for four years now and struggled to find something on par with where we have lived previosuly until we discovered Kai Zan in November 2012. In many ways, this has been our baby. We have watched it grow from a 17 seater relatively easy place to get a reservation place to a restaurant highly recommended and regarded by lthe ocal food press. That said, the service and personal touch has not changed as the place has grown up.The wait staff are really good and welcoming. Each table is given a 2 hour allocation, but we find them very accomodating if the group is having a good time and you run over a little bit. The owners Carlo and Melvin are a real treat. They offer amuse bouches. That could be because we come in about every 6 weeks, but my guess is it is something they just like to do. They make an effort to come by the tables to interact with the guests. Both of them are incredibly humble and warm people. One can even get off menu items. The uni toro tartare is an example of this!My recommendation to first time diners is to either do the $60 or $90 tasting. If you can afford the $90, I would recommend doing this. This place is great for groups as they have booths that can seat 6 people and contain the noise of the group very nicely.I was slighly saddened to see them move away from BYOB even though I am not a big drinker until I saw that the drink menu is quite reasonable. The last time we were in there a bottle of nice white wine was only $21. This is a place that is also good to bring people who may not be the biggest fans of sushi as they have char-broil items that are delicious as well. They did a pop up ramen night, which my wife said was delicious. It would be great to see them do this more often or even incorporate into the menu, but I can understand if they want to keep the menu more focused on traditional cuisine.Carlos and Melvin well done, you have a great restaurant and a place we always take visitors to town.

We also had the Apple Pie Shot which is definitely worth ordering for dessert - really unique dessert that I dont mind bragging about.Also, even though its no longer BYOB the wine is a great price.

Spectacular food. Best gem is when you ask the waitstaff for their recommendation, and they lock up because they have a hard time telling you which one they love most.Since we were in the loop, getting here required taking a bit of drive with Uber to get there. Well worth it though./ATMOSPHEREOne way to describe this place would be small. From the outside, it looks it. Inside, its perfectly cramped which creates a type of intimate surrounding. The booths near the sushi bar are private in a way since the walls are very high. The decor was quite warm and inviting./FOODWe went with the recommendation the waitstaff provided. It was on point. If you need an idea, go for the pearls. We couldnt decide between the escolar or maguro pearls so they split a single dish. Honestly, it was the best thing we ate there.I dont know though. I mean... char siu? Ridiculous. So damn good. We also had a selection of maki rolls. They were probably my least favorite but still definitely memorable./SERVICEExcellent. Attentive. Knowledgable.

We were celebrating Christmas early since we were going to be separated by the ocean during the holidays.To treat ourselves, we headed to Kai Zan! I made reservations for a Tuesday night dinner. When we arrived, I knew it was going to be a small space. But dear lord, it really was TINY. I think it might be slightly larger than my garage. We opted to get the omakase and it started off pretty slowly. We had the peppers, followed by a jalapeno popper, uni shooters, and I forgot what else. To be honest, I was quite disappointed. Perhaps Ive been building up too much hype in my mind, but I thought that the offering was rather boring. I liked the shooters. Actually, I liked them a lot. But that was probably one of the few standout points of the meal. I started to really pay attention when we decided to order 2 additional dishes after we were done with the omakase just because we werent full. Both were nice pieces of fish belly. It was served simply and it really let the fish speak for itself.The service was alright. We came in knowing that we were going to order the omakase, but when the food came, the hostess/waitress didnt explain what we were eating. We had to flag someone down to explain what was in front of us. But other than that, the chefs were nice. I dont know which brother it was, but he kept on asking if we were enjoying ourselves.The boy liked the overall meal more than I did. I just expected more, whether it was mixing up textures or serving it in a different way. It felt like everything was either wrapped in escolar, an escolar roll, a slice of escolar belly, etc. Sweet Jesus, what happened to other fish?! Sorry, just not enough innovation for me.',8);

I have to say, without exaggerating at all, this was the best seafood experience I have ever had in Chicago. Every single course contained the freshest and highest quality fish. I am super picky about sushi and especially sashimi, but this literally melts in your mouth. Every course was full of surprises and full of bold flavors. I have attached all of the food from the courses to this review if you want to check it out. Its BYOB but the corkage fee is $15, which has gone up from when they first started. The Omakase 12-course menu is $60/person, which is very very reasonable for the amount of quality food you get. Although the neighborhood seems sketchy, its really not bad.

Slight tweaking of flavors with a bit of oil, tobiko, and greens, but this is the way a fresh offshoot of sashimi is supposed to shine! Fiesta maki the freshness of the fish made this awesome.

The ambiance is pretty perfect for date nights the service is top notch only had bad service one time. If ur looking for unique sushi that doesnt have imitation crab or cream cheese this is the place for you ps bring back the black bean ice cream plz!! N plz put those cute edible orchids in dishes like before i miss that. If u dont wanna get the chef tasting menu order this exactly for the best meal of ur life angry crab/orange rush/ calamari/ escolar pearls/flaming tuna roll duck on a stick/pork belly/collar of the day/ fried octopus/grilled scallop nigiri/ for dessert Charred kabocha chocolate mouse and get the specials!! Always get all of the specialsMiso soup i liked this better then the tuna dashi. It has alot of mushrooms which i love the soup is really hot perfect when its cold the mushrooms arent cooked there in the soup raw but the heat of the broth makes themSoft. Then theres tofu which is really interesting there so soft only complaint would be more depth of flavor its good but not to the point where id order againTuna dashi this was okay not my fav its interesting it tastes like ocean water u know when u go swim n the water goes in ur mouth on accident thats what it tastes like wouldnt order again fix the fishy tasteFried octopus this was really flavorful the sauce was divine really rich really enhances the dish the octopus is really tender however i wish there was a bigger piece inside the bonito flakes werent an odd texture thats what made it perfectGreen monster good but not enough filling in the middle bbq eel needs more filling Fiesta roll really delicious u could really taste the seafood then theres avocado nothings better then that in sushi. I didnt taste any jalepeno or the other mexican flavors though its not a bad roll just i was expecting jalepeno didnt get that Wagyu pearls omg food-gasim the beef is cooked to perfect to the point where it melts in ur mouth. Then theres truffle on it this is so rich to the point where ur mouth feels likeIts in heaven Fried chicken its perfectly crisp to the point of sounding like photochips it isnt greasy at all the chicken was really tender. The problem was it had no sauce and was really bland actually. Put a sauce on plz!!!! We asked for hot sauce n they gave us a mayo with chili oil that made it extra good with soy sauce added to for a much needed salt flavorOrange rush presentation so cute! This is one of my favorites i usually dont like acidic dishes because there to acidic but this isnt at all the orange flavor goes perfectly with the richness of the fish. The seafood is cooked perfectly Grilled scallop nigiri omg when scallops are cooked perfectly its like eating a cloud just melts in ur mouth the sauces went perfect with the fish to make it rich but not to overpowering a must order!!Tuna belly if u never tried tuna belly order it now its better then any other tuna sushi u ever had before. This is really high quality topshelf tuna. Its cooked perfectly so it melts in ur mouth ur tastebuds will love u if u order thisYaki soba i was a little skeptical but its delicious this is the only dish where they give u a big portion. The noodles are cooked perfectly seasoned beautifully theres alot of texture i recommend ordering it with a meat Char sui (pork belly) omg omg best pork belly ever!! Its so good i love pork belly this by far was my favorite rendition of it. Its cooked perfectly so the fatty parts melt in ur mouth its not tuff at all. The sauce is to die for and the kimchi is kinda mild which it was more spicier n vinegary the sauce is to die for ask for extra though theres only a lil bitFish collar (salmon) {warning bones alot to the point where its easy to choke} omg order this! fish collar is the equivalent of a seafood ribeye. Its so rich like it has such a great fish flavor cooked perfectly the sauce adds a much needed salty richness u wont regret ordering thisCharred kabocha (best dessert ever) picture like a pumpkin pie but a 100 times better it was amazin the pumpkin was cooked perfectly not hard seasoned just right to remind u of thanksgivin. The icecream perfect texture complimented the pumpkin beutifully the best part was the pecan streusal amaizin so crunchy ask for more streusal thoughChocolate mouse this was our second favorite dessert. Its really delicous the rice crispy is really cruncy tastes like a gormea cereal.

The restaurant itself is very tiny with limited seating so making reservations in advance is highly recommended (almost required if youre in a large group). There are seats at the sushi bar as well as intimate cozy booths where we were seated (booths seat six people comfortably). After taking our seats, we were greeted by our server who gave each of us hot towels to clean our hands which I thought was a very lovely touch. He explained the concept of the restaurant and answered any questions we had regarding the menu. For those who havent been to Kai Zan, I recommend going with the chefs choice omakase which costs you $60, but you get to sample some of the most popular items on the menu and its so much food! This way, the next time you come (...and you will be back, trust me...), youll know exactly what to get. Below is what we had on the omakase menu on our visit to Kai Zan with some extra dishes.COURSE 1 - ESCOLAR and MAGURO PEARLSOur omakase experience off with a big flavorful bang. These pearls were an absolute treat. I contemplated ordering more after finishing my four pieces. Hell, I contemplated stealing my friends pearls while they werent looking. These little nuggets of deliciousness are topped with soy and truffle oil soaked scallions which take the incredibly fresh cuts of fish to another level.COURSE 2 - MADAI CARPACCIO Slices of red snapper topped with fatty toro, black tobiko that pops in your mouth and drizzled with olive oil and soy sauce. I enjoyed this dish, but to be honest, I was still thinking about those pearls lolCOURSE 3 - OYSTER AND SCALLOP SHOOTERSI have been looking forward to trying the shooters ever since we booked the reservation and they did not disappoint! Both shooters were served in a citrusy ponzu sauce with a rich quail egg and dash of spicy Tabasco sauce. The meaty scallop was so sweet and succulent, but my favorite was the briny oyster shooters. I couldve eaten another 5 or 10 - SO GOOD!COURSE 4 - ANGRY CRAB The angry crab was a tasty bite with spicy crab wrapped in fresh tuna and topped with crispy tempura flakes COURSE 5 - TUNATINI This course was a party in your mouth because there were so many different textures with each bite you took from the buttery tuna to the crispy polenta to the herbaceous shiso leaf to the salty black tobiko that popped in your mouth.COURSE 6 - DASHIThis piping hot cup of dashi broth was just what we needed on a cold rainy Chicago night loaded with mushrooms, tuna, clams and sesame seeds -- warmed and satisfied our tummies.COURSE 7 - SHRIMP. TAKOYAKI. PORK BELLY. OCTOPUS SALADSampling of four dishes shrimp was served with shiitake and garlic butter. The takoyaki was perfect -- crisp exterior and gooey center with octopus inside topped with wasabi mayo and bonito flakes. The pork belly was so unctuous, tender and juicy; it practically melted in my mouth. The octopus salad ways my least favorite out of the quartet of offerings -- too much wasabi that overwhelmed everything else in the dish.COURSE 8 - DYNAMITE MUSSELSThese are gigantic New Zealand mussels that are steamed with sake and topped with black tobiko and negi mayo. AMAZING -- I need the recipe because I could devour a platter all by myself.COURSE 9 - FLAMING TUNA. GREEN MONSTER. FIESTA MAKIMy favorite was the flaming tuna which is a shrimp tempura roll topped with seared tuna and truffle soaked scallions so basically the pearls on steroids haha. The fiesta maki has all my favorite things salmon, tuna, jalapeño, cilantro, avocado and masago. I enjoyed the green monster, but compared to the other rolls, it was my least favorite; the texture was too soft.COURSE 10 - ESCOLAR. SALMON. YELLOWTAIL. TUNAEach piece of sashimi I tasted was incredibly fresh; my favorites were the escolar and salmon - rich, buttery and fatty.DESSERTS - CHOCOLATE MOUSSE & KABOCHA My friends ended the meal on a sweet note with chocolate mousse with puffed rice and green tea sauce as well as charred kabocha squash which was served with ice cream. The mousse was good although there was an ingredient in it none of my friends could quite put our fingers on. I didnt try the squash, but everyone seemed to enjoy it.EXTRAS - TORO UNI TARTAREEven though I was already full, I haaad to order it! Fatty toro and buttery uni served over a bed of sushi rice with quail eggs, scallions and freshly grated wasabi. How bad could that be?! Served with nori so you can make diy rolls. Cant even put into words how good it was - truly exceptional and flavors were sublime! ORDER THIS!Everybody from the hostess to the servers was incredibly gracious, attentive and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Service was paced beautifully where we never felt rushed to leave. Im counting down the days until I can return for another drool-worthy dinner experience!',0);

The omakase is 15 courses and definitely enough for two people to share, especially if you double up on some of the items that come in one portion. My favorites were the madai carpaccio, escolar pearls, and the polenta bites (I think--this was on the house). While Im usually not a huge fan of anything that deviates from traditional sushi, I appreciated the creativity that went into the rolls--the flavors were unique and well thought out. The kale in the polenta bites, for instance, was crispy, and the slightly bitter flavors worked surprisingly well with the toro. We also got an order of the madai collar, which was also quite good and well priced for the portion size.The one thing I would stay away from would be the traditional sashimi; this may have been an off day, but the sashimi I had was not very fresh, especially the maguro, which was a very oxidized, dark color.

The last sashimi course was far from mindblowing, with thin slices of salmon, lean tuna, super white tuna and yellowtail that were not very fresh and feel like I could pay elsewhere for.

In other words, I tasted more of the tuna, not much of the spicy crab itself.  6) char siu/beef tataki surprisingly, this meat dish was light because of the addition of yuzu.  7) shiitake mushroom soup it also featured a tiny piece of oyster on the bottom.  I enjoyed the broth; it was flavorful yet simple.8) an assortment of entree dishes what a luxury way to present the takoyaki!  Although the takoyaki wasnt my favorite, the octopus with wasabi sauce was a nice change-up for the palate!  You could definitely experience umami with this chefs creative combo.  9) dynamite mussel the flavor of sake was soaked throughly into the mussel.  Sprinkling some of the lemon juice was a must!  Im now have a brand-new perspective on mussels.  10) fiesta maki how could you go wrong with avocado and fresh raw seafood?  11) an assortment of sashimi the presentation was impeccable!  That was an awesome final chapter of the Omakase.  The service was very attentive.  Dining at Kai Zan was certainly an unforgettable experience.  I have no doubt that we will be back for the premium Omakase!  The street parking was fairly easy on Chicago Ave.  Otherwise, the CTA 66 (Chicago) bus can take you there, and be sure that you get off at Rockwell/Chicago.',4);

Kai Zan isnt your mommas sushi restaurant so check your expectations.. and everything you know about sushi at the door. Now step in. The decor will quite literally set the tone for the rest of the night, its dark..moody...sexy... you may blush a little when you step in even. The staff is incredibly friendly though and youll feel at ease immediately. If youre lucky you might get seated at the bar so you can watch the magic happen, but the cozy booths lend themselves to a more intimate seating if youre there as a couple or a small group and want your privacy. While stalking Kai Zans instagram I basically had my heart set on trying out their Omakase menu ...but literally everything screams to be eaten and the choices are insane! how do you pick one over the other?? the Omakase is a 10 course hand selected menu by the chefs which really does introduce you to almost everything on the menu. Its special.. it truly is special. We started off with the Japanese Red Snapper wrapped around toro and topped with basil miso olive oil and tobiko... and ZOMG!!! I may have had a moment ... wink wink ....followed by more amazingness.. but my personal favorite had to be the Oyster and scallop shooters topped with ponzu sauce and fresh Uni.. how is this even real life? So glad we got 2 shooters each cuz theres no way I would have settled for just 1. I think the chef over heard me gushing about my love affair with Uni, cuz he ended up treating us to an extra course of hamachi with uni on the house.. over this amazing sweet mango sauce of some sort.. I stopped paying attention to every detail after some time.. youll see the pictures on my IG and know what Im talking about.  I just wanted to enjoy each bite and every moment. By the end of dinner we were sufficiently stuffed..split dessert between the two of us and had a couple drinks. Definitely made for a fun girls night out and you really do need to go here with someone who appreciates sashimi in its best form. Save this one for a special night... but make it happen soon!',0);

In a way she was giving us her tasting menu and did not disappoint! By far the star of the night was the escolar pearls.This dish had four bite size escolar nigiri lightly seared with a side of special ponzu sauce. Very light and refreshing. Just amazing!Everything she recommended was spot on. We ordered the angry crab  - spicy crab wrapped in fresh tuna, topped w/ tempura crunchWe each got one piece. The fatty tuna and spicy crab really go well together. Just divineorange rush - sushi scallops wrapped in salmon, lightly seared with a citrus glazeI would really recommend this too. Never knew salmon and scallops paired so well. Definitely you notice a theme where the dishes are great for one whole bite and the sushi is fresh and flavors really really go well togetherWe also got the following.Dynamite Mussels - better than the ones found in normal sushi restaurantsChar siu skewers - reminds me of the char siu found in ramen but so tenderhotate skewers - good scallopssalmon nigiri (super fresh)    At the end of the night she recommend this clam dashi that was not on the menu but definitely cleansed our palate.

Clearly, the sushi chefs experienced Japan with the rice being light and airy, warmed in the hand and not cold, packed together like you find at other sushi restaurants.  We ordered salmon, tuna (maguro and chu-toro), yellowtail (hamachi), and ebi (sweet shrimp).  We also got two specials the uni (sea urchi) tartare seaweed handrolls and wagyu beef nigiri.  The wagyu is slightly kissed by a torch and melts like butter in your mouth.  It is one of the best pieces of beef Ive had.  The ebi is also done right (not pink from being cooked).  We ordered some sushi rolls and they were above average as well.  If you want fresh nigiri, this is the place.  A shoutout to our server, Brian, who was fantastic and able to get us salmon belly and yellowtail belly cuts.',3);

Please note, they are closed Wednesdays. The interior is intimate and casual, though unlike many small sushi restaurants who maximize space by decreasing your personal space, Kai Zan has booths lining the wall that feel spacious and personal thanks to trendy dividers.

The restaurant was extremely generous, and dish after dish kept coming out. Overall, I wish I could have given the place a 6. Reservations can be made online through their website. I would plan at least 2 to 3 weeks out for a weekend reservation. Absolutely worth a try for the sushi fan.',2);

Im not qualified to discuss or accurately describe the various flavor profiles that danced across my tongue.  All I can tell you is that it was a delightful and delicious experience; the likes of which if you enjoy sushi or consider yourself a foodie - Kai Zan.  It is everything youve read/heard.PS.  The service was exceptional.  There were so many courses, I think we were presented by each person working there.  They were all able to walk us through the different dishes; the takeaway being that the restaurant worked together as a team.PPS.  Yes, its a nice little story, but Kai Zan is a true treasure.  Im very happy to add back the stars.  Bonus  To bring it all full circle, you can now make reservations for Kai Zan through Yelp.',6);

She was fabulous enough to email me and let me know a  815 pm reservation was available.  Talk about top-notch service; it really makes all the difference.The restaurant is still tiny but I heard had expanded recently.  We got one of those prime seats right next to the bar and cooking station where the sushi twins were hard at work.  Best seats in the house!Two words - Omakase menu.  This is a 12 course chefs tasting menu for $60/pp.  If sushi is a meaningful aspect of your foodie life, whats the point in looking elsewhere?  Well, maybe theres just one more option.  Allan, our server says theres a brand new tasting menu that offers a higher level of sushi experience and costs $100/person for 11 courses.  I decide to hold off on this until next time.  Lets face it; there will be a next time.  Plus, thats pretty pricey.My husband graciously accompanied me although he doesnt eat sushi.  So, he stuck with the cooked portion of the menu.  I will normally try everything he eats but I was so mesmerized with Omakase that I paid little attention to what he got.  I know he got beef steak and really enjoyed it.The Omakase was spectacular.  No words will truly do the menu justice.  There was fish galore.  There was carpaccio, maguro, tuna, oyster shooter with a zing that you slurp up, out of this world angry crab, more tuna, fish cloaked in avocado that literally melts in your mouth, salmon, scallops, octopus, shrimp tempura, roe toppings and an awesome soup.  There was more but I dont remember it all.  Last course was a platter of sashimi to die for.  In all, truly a roller coaster ride.  I was trying to jot down notes but couldnt keep up.  The fish was so fresh, there were many different and unique flavors, some topped with mayo and accompanied by wasabi for the kick.  Good sushi is never cheap and $60 is a great price for what you get.     At one point my husband says - Thats a lot of fish.  As in - Are you really going to eat all that?  Oh heck yah it was a decent amount of fish and I ate every single last piece.They even serve the most wonderful version of soy sauce.  Not sure quite whats in it but I made it my mission to find enough food to soak it in.  I probably would have drank the left-over sauce if it came down to it.The restaurant started off as just BYO but they now serve wine and sake.  They dont however advertise their drink menu as you cannot find it on their website.  The BYO option is now $15/table.  Im a firm believer that drinking anything but sake with sushi is a sin.  Allans first recommendation was for us to try the wandering poet junmai ginjo and I couldnt agree more.  This happened to be the first pouring by sommelier Jill Gubesch at our Topolo dinner and is an outstanding sake.  Most of the sake is offered as 300 ml size options with around four offerings in the 720 ml size.  Sake tends to have a higher alcohol content than wine; we therefore opted for the 300 ml option.  About halfway through the meal, we went with bride of the fox; another junmai ginjo.  Spectacular and once again an incredible smooth finish that was a flawless accompany to the food.We both wanted dessert and selected the homemade cheesecake and lava cake.  Both were delicious; portions were small which was perfect.  The lava cake was topped with sesame ice cream and was uniquely delectable, satisfying, without being extremely filling.Even the ambiance is sheer perfection.  The restaurant is small and intimate.  It works for couples that want to hang out or friends that want to get together.  It works for date night.  It works for girls night out.  It seriously works for any occasion.  The menu is a bit rushed but I do not hold this against the restaurant.  My preference would have been to spend double the time I was there as I like time between courses.  Their website states that parties of 2 are limited to 90 minutes of dining time as they are a small restaurant and there is high demand.  Guess I can live with that.

Having recently enjoyed the best sushi experience of my life at Kusakabe in San Francisco, my wife and I were hoping to find a venue to fall in love with in Chicago to frequent regularly. The first annoying aspect had to do with the time limit on ones reservation. Kai Zan used to be BYOB and is a smallish venue, so I can understand the concept of a time limit to prevent people from lingering after the food is gone to finish wine - costing the restaurant revenue and delaying reservations to follow. However now that Kai Zan has a liquor license and serves wine, sake and beer this seems unnecessary. And it was complete overkill to inform me of a 90 minute time limit (for two-tops) and 120 minute limit (four for tops) when reserving online, then again via voice mail when Kai Zan called to confirm the reservation, then a third time when I called them back (as requested) to confirm I received their confirmation. Before entering I actually half expected to see a stop watch on the table counting down my allotted time. That said the initial impression upon arrival was positive. We were dining with another couple and our friends arrived early and were immediately seated rather than made to wait for our arrival. Loved our placement as well; spacious, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing booth surrounded by three walls - almost like a mini private dining room. Our primary server, Brian, was rather friendly as well.At Kai Zan one has the option of a la carte, a ten course Chefs Choice Omakase ($60 per/person) that involves a progression of items from the a la carte menu (dessert is optional and additional) or a premium Omakase (price varies, was $130 the night we dined - this involves a sequence of courses generally not on the a la carte menu and it is recommended to be requested in advance due to limited availability). We opted for the $60 Omakase and had our server recommend some sakes by the glass to pair (he made some nice recommendations and often brought samples to try before committing to the glass which was much appreciated). The major disappointment involved the generally mediocre quality of the cuisine. While all but one course was fine, there were zero stand outs and lots of repetition (i.e. big eye tuna was featured in quite a few of the ten courses; a generic fish that you expect to find at an inexpensive all-you-can-eat sushi venue). There was a nice variety of presentations (i.e. rolls, sashimi, nigiri, shooters, soup, a fun course where you create a taco by wrapping tuna and seaweed into a shiso leaf etc.) but with rare exception they were no better quality wise (or just a small step up) from fare Ive received at unheralded run-of-the-mill sushi joints. Often truffle oil or citrus sauces overpowered the fish and the high quality experience we were expecting was just not there. In addition to an overabundance of big eye tuna, tobiko was present as a component in nearly every course. One dish, a mushroom soup was nearly inedible; unpleasantly salty broth and a smelly, extremely fishy tasting piece of cheap tuna. The sake was definitely the biggest hit of the evening at our table with the Bride of the Fox being the consensus favorite. In addition to the food being a let down, a couple other negatives (on top of the aforementioned annoyance regarding the time limit); at times beverage service was slow (at one point three courses came and went from the time my wife ordered a glass of sake to the time it arrived) and periodically the courses were brought in such rapid succession it resulted in feeling kind of rushed (i.e. twice new courses arrived before the previous course was consumed - and it was not attributable to us dawdling). When dropping over $100 per/person (including food/drink/tax/gratuity) I expect at least a somewhat leisurely dining experience. I do have to give credit to Kai Zan for value; even though the food only generally ranged from OK to pretty good, we did receive a lot of courses for $60 (often with more than one distinct component per course) and I left completely full (we also ordered one supplemental roll, a Japanese Wagyu roll with freshly shaved black truffle - but nothing else extra). That said I think Kai Zan needs to either up the price of the Chefs Choice Omakase and include better variety and quality of fish or have a middle tier option between the $130 Premium and $60 Chefs Choice where without breaking the bank one can receive a meal that is clearly elevated from what is available at nearly every sushi joint in town.',15);

You barely have space to walk around (that is if you ever need to). The place isnt decorated like your typical sushi bar, because it isnt one. Kai Zan is more of a fusion sushi place, I dont think people who hate fusion sushi places would be fond of this place much. Although, it is not the typical fusion sushi either, where all their dishes are carefully made with great ingredients that go well together that are not things like stupid cream cheese or spicy mayo.All I hear about this place is its Omakase. The fact that I was there the first time and didnt want to bother looking at the menu much or take time to think my order through because everything sounds delicious leaned me towards ordering the Omakase. This way, I would be able to taste the best of the menu that the Chef wants to offer his diners. Overall food was great, everything had great balance to it. Theres about 10 courses, so you dont really have to order anything else.

We didnt want to wait that long and just settled for our table. It wasnt too bad, by the window overlooking the bar, so we got to see all the action. I absolutely loved the decor and atmosphere here, perhaps more than Coast and Toro combined, it was sheek, but not overly done, not too loud and the wooden tables gave it that rustic feel which you dont usually get at these sushi places, it had that upscale feel without overwhelming prices. Okay, so now onto the important stuff, the goodies. We started with the dynamite mussels and Oh em gee were those amazing. You definitely need to try those, they are a tad spicy and comes six for $12. Definitely a great start to your meal. What I didnt like is that your sushi doesnt come out all at once, it comes out as its ready. Having said that, they mixed up a few of our rolls adding avocado instead of cucumber and forgot to bring the green monster roll for my friend. But the server made up for it later on by giving us all dessert on the house since we had to wait a little longer than most people and some of the rolls were wrong. Anyways, we got the angry crab, made with fresh tuna, spicy crab with chefs togarashi. It was delicious and also comes in a hand roll version for $9. We seriously got three of those by the end of the night. Then my husband got what I believe is the fiesta roll with plenty of fresh fish which he seemed to enjoy, dont quote me on the name though and its not on the website. We also got a bunch of simple spicy salmon, avocado with eel rolls just to get a feel of the fish. And the fish was super fresh and tasty and the prices overall were very decent for what you get. Like I said, although the service was a little shaky, she made up for it by the end and we got chocolate lava cake, mango pudding and green tea ice cream for the table. They were all yummy but not memorable. Sushi is where its at in this place and next time I will definitely call way in advance to try to get that private room. Kai Zan, youre a new sushi favorite of mine.',2);

Our server Chris was nice, and did his best to provide a good experience, but the philosophy of the management here is get in, get the hell out fast.Three of us ordered the Omakase.  The pacing of the coursing is absurd!  We had three or four courses brought out within minutes, both hot and cold items.  Theres no point in doing a tasting and exploring a restaurants menu when the chefs insist on sending everything out in chaos without any direction or order.  We asked Chris what the deal was and he said hed try to slow it down.  Sometimes three items at once would come out, then nothing for 20 to 30 minutes or so.  I realize this may sound a bit whiny, but again, how simple of a concept is it to allow guests to savor and reflect on each course, rather than just shove food at us like were at a buffet?In addition to the ridiculous pacing, almost every dish had mayo on it.  In some instances it worked well, but often I felt it just distracted from what should be clean, thoughtful flavors.  The moment the last piece of sushi was eaten from our plates, they were cleared and a check was dropped.  Literally minutes after we paid, the receipts were collected, and the manager (Im assuming, as she never introduced herself)  asked us to leave since she had other tables.  Theres a tough balance for restaurants in providing a good experience to its guests while also turning tables, but there was no tact or intelligence in this one.  The right thing to do would have been to politely give us a heads up that in a few minutes theyd need the table, and offer a remedy, such as, such and such bar down the street is fun, this place is good for coffee, etc..  Kai Zan lacks tact, execution, and elegance, but not mayonaise.',1);

Not to say that this is a bad thing, but then from what I have experienced from this first time visit today, Kai Zan has definitely pulled the beginners club card upon my boyfriend and I as we were in the restaurant for about nearly two hours, oogling over the 10-course wonder that is the premium Omakase dinner. I feel that Kai Zan tries to live up to its expectations and the ever-tenacious repertoire of tuna-loving sushi freaks based in the West who have not even gone outside the realms of the gang of four salmon, tuna, yellowtail (hamachi), and ebi (shrimp), with their names in acronym form read out as stye, which is probably enough clues to why I think that my visit to Kai Zan has made me feel like someone who is completely clueless and new to sushi.Back to what I ordered the 10-course Premium Omakase Dinner. It is advertised as having non-traditional ingredients, which looked very intriguing, as Kai Zan seems to pride itself over as having a Fusion element with their food as well. At the time my boyfriend and I ordered this, it was $130 per person. Under the assumption that Kai Zan interprets Omakase as up to the chef[s mood and choice], we were cool with everything until we realized that were still in a sushi establishment based in the West. Our server, who I forgot the name of (Im sorry in advance!) answered a few questions that we had as much as she could, mainly with concerns of being served rolls, wraps, and gimmicks to please the individuals who aim to eat foreign cuisines to appear more cultured or exotic. Bad news was the Omakase here is very much a predetermined menu, which really made me a bit wary about what was about to come. Good news was she ensured that we wouldnt receive any of that bad stuff, which we are THANKFUL for, but then we stumbled upon the next level of how sushi culture became a realm for buzzwords and people trekking to Japans Tsukiji Market in Tokyo just to take pictures of tuna, boasting about the price and name of the meat rather than the quality, and then leaving promptly without getting a taste.Buzzwords. Ootoro, Chuutoro, Akami, and Wagyu are the main triggers when it comes to thinking about Japanese food. We received all of these, if not more in our dinner tonight. Im not sad about it. Im not mad about it either. Its just that I felt a bit underwhelmed for paying $130 to receive stuff that is of excellent quality, taste, and presentation, but not that interesting nor memorable. So much for the innovation that seemed to burst out of this place. Out of the 10 dishes we had, at least 4 of them had some sort of tuna in it. Having one sort of thing once is great. Having one sort of thing in different variables but then are tangent to each other (i.e. ootoro nigiri with pickled wasabi, then shoyu glazed chuutoro)?? No, thank you!!! Also, there was no uni in our selection. Im a bit shocked there myself, having paid that amount and not receiving the therapeutic treatment of sea urchin, but instead having a load of fatty-cut fish served to me with no innovative palate cleanser in sight or mind to balance the elements out. It was extremely heavy on the mouth, and by extension, the soul and the stomach; contrary to the nature of enjoying sushi, sashimi and nigiri. Sure, this would be an excellent sensory and pleasure overload to those who arent that acquainted with the taste and art of raw fish, but then I was looking for something to remember, something unique. And thats why I decided on getting the Premium Omakase, let alone an Omakase meal. I left disappointed. I was expecting to be served stuff that will give me the chills, something that I wouldnt be able to recover from, leaving me wanting for more. I didnt feel like I got the Omakase treatment that usually entails a spur of the moment choice to go with whatever has been served to my table already, plus the requirement of ingenuity that comes with being called an Asian Fusion place that would make my head, heart, and stomach race with excitement. After the honeymoon period of my meal, I just felt completely empty and couldnt even recall what I have ate less than an hour ago. I would want to give Kai Zan another shot at redeeming themselves whenever I have the cash to spare, or if someone is willing to treat me there (*wink wink, nudge nudge*).If you want a good sushi experience here, get the Omakase. If you want an even better sushi experience here, research a bit before you visit, and write down what you want to try since Kai Zan can make stuff to order, as long as its a standard sushi, sashimi, or nigiri item of course. You played it too safe, Kai Zan. Until next time.',15);

I have read so many good things about Kai Zan and couldnt wait to come here to check it out. The hubs and I had reservations last night. In short- our pompous server tainted our experience and we felt like we got ripped off. The deets  After being seated for 15 minutes, our waiter finally came by to offer to open our wine. Side note- the place is so small there are 5 tables and a sushi bar. We were seated at the sushi bar and he had to walk by us at least a dozen times before acknowledging us. Anyways, 10 MINUTES LATER he still hasnt delivered our opened bottle of wine. We wanted to walk out, and would have had he not been holding captive the wine we brought. In retrospect we should have walked out and just said sayonara to the vino. We started with the escolar pearls. They were really tasty but small for $8. Ok fine. Still feeling optimistic. We ordered the 3 of their featured sushi items. Eel wrapped in tuna, angry crab, and scallop wrapped in salmon. Each were $8. We expected them to be rolls. Instead, we discovered that they were 2 bites per order, equating to 1 bite per person. Where we felt the most taken advantage of though was on the sashimi we ordered. They had 2 sashimi specials of fresh fish they were featuring. One was a steelhead trout, the other was toro. The other sashimi items we were going to order were $3 a piece. Of course having been tempted by the sound of the specials, we ordered 2 pieces of each. When the bill came we found out they were 3 times the price of all other sashimi- $9 a piece!! Lovely surprise when the bill came to discover that 2 bites per person cost $36. Our server was MIA for the most part but when he was present to deliver our next dish, he couldnt be bothered. The whole experience just left a bad taste in my mouth.  I get that the fish quality was really good, and honestly we liked everything we got. That is the only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review. But we left starving after spending $80. There are so many great, super fresh sushi joints in the city and Im just sorry I wasted a dime at this one.',25);

Ill fully admit, I havent had sushi from tokyo and whatever other great sushi cities one can come up with. I have had what I believe to be very good sushi, and Kai Zan is heads and shoulders above anything else Ive had. I went here with 3 other friends. Were all very into wine, so yes, many bottles were brought. I do love that they are completely BYO, and yea, we kinda abused that. Thankfully the staff was cool with it and we made sure to reward them for that. Anyway, its near impossible to get into all of the food. Mostly because we just let our waitress pick for us. So, food would just appear and she would tell us what we were having. I was only paying so much attention and more just focused on the killer fish in front of me. We started off with the oyster shooters and the escolar pearls. The oyster shooters are a complete trip with them being so wrong that they are insanely right. The escolar pearls were absolutely awesome and should be ordered by everyone. Here is where things got hazy as it was one order after the other. I do remember there being some steelhead trout sashimi that was amazing and a fiery crab (or was it angry crab?) that we had to order twice. The major point being though, everything put in front of us was both gorgeous in its presentation and just as delicious as it looked. Kai Zan is a very small spot. We were there for a little over an hour and we could see a line forming out the door, so we did have to leave a bit sooner than we probably wouldve liked.

Rich, flavorful, complex but also subdued in a way that let each ingredient shine while combining superbly with each other.A rare experience.Another great surprise was the bite-size kushi skewers; the shitake-ponzu one should illustrate umami in a dictionary. The best $3 spent on food in your life. It totally beat the crap of the scallop-onion one, and God knows I love scallops.

Favorites- Uni shooters and oyster shooters Both were delicious, but I was surprised to find that I liked the uni significantly better than the oyster (and I usually love all things oyster). - Escolar and maguro pearls These were both equally delicious and just as everyone else has mentioned, easily a favorite of the night.- Angry Crab A bite of heaven and the wasabi perfectly hits you at the end.  Its like it was created in layers so you can taste each individual layer as youre chewing and each has a distinct flavor.- Steelhead Trout Sashimi  Imagine the best salmon sashimi youve ever had...and then imagine having something similar but twice as delicious.- Tako The octopus salad was served at the perfect time, the vinegar was light and refreshing to cleanse our mouths and the touch of wasabi was nice.- Unagi Poppers The jalapeno poppers were also very tasty, but I was a little confused.  They were said to have had unagi inside the jalapeno, but there was none, so I think somebody messed up there.  Either way, the panko covered jalapeno with cream cheese and eel sauce was not their most original creation of the night, but still tasty and enjoyable.- Shrimp with Shitaki Mushrooms The shrimp was good but the moist and barely cooked shitaki mushroom cap with delicious ginger dressing and other sauces was fantastic.- Mussel My memory escapes me, but we had a mussel on a shell dressed in deliciousness.  I had hoped wed get to try the Orange Crush, but the mussel was a wonderful substitute.- Sushi Roll The sushi roll came out towards the end, as we were all discussing how there was no way we could eat any more food, so my fiance ended up eating most of this for the team.  Im not sure what the roll was called but it was a simple roll of tuna and cucumber, salmon and a bit of spicy sauce.  It was delicious, but I could only eat one bite.Not Our Favorites- Agedashi Tofu The broth that the tofu was served in was downright drinkable, but the tofu itself was bland and unseasoned and a little bit boring.- Enoki Bacon I didnt try this one, but the other two said it was just ok.- Grilled Yellowtail A little bit bland and boring as well.- Charred Smelt I believe this dish was prepared to perfection and Chris seemed disappointed that we didnt enjoy it, as its one of his favorites.  But the smelt was just a little bit too fishy for our tastes.  If youre okay with strong fish (and okay with eating whole fish, head to tail), youll love this.Service was prompt and friendly.  They were great about clearing dishes quickly, always explained what each dish was and recommended the best way to eat it, and did not make us feel rushed at any time.  The place is very cozy and casual and welcoming.  I cant wait to go back again.',17);

Kai Zan - out in Humbolt Park on Chicago ave. Simply put, it has all the right ingredients (pun intended) to go viral and cultish. Its small (like 20 seats), awesome decor, BYO, off the beaten path, and happens to serve delicious food thats not your typical maki roll from Dominicks. And its crazy affordable. Not much else you need to score big.The meal started off with a bang by ordering the Escolar Pearls  (rice spheres topped with scallions and super white tuna soaked in soy sauce, truffle oil, spicy mayo, and chili oil, then lightly seared), and sides of edamame and gomae. The pearls of little rice with amazing flavors on top were so good and had four pieces for the three of us that we need another order. Easy call. Delicious. We all said we could come back for a meal entirely of Pearls (theres Maguro too, for variety).We followed the pearls with some sushi/sashimi. I believe we ordered some hamachi sashimi (not 100% on that), the flaming tuna roll and the orange rush sushi. The sashimi was nice but a little fatty/tough for my preference. Light sauce was very nice. Loved the flaming tuna, had a lot of fun items and nice texture variety. Really nice. Finally, the orange rush gives the pearls a run for their money for favorite of the meal. Its served on a single shell, and is a one bite show. Theres scallop on some rice entirely wrapped in salmon with a nice citrus glaze. Big fan, would order again and multiple. We also tried some of the yakatori to get a little variety and try the menu. We had the chicken, shrimp and beef. Everything was nice and flavorful (though Id stick with the amazing fish), and the shrimp was the best and most interesting option (and really cool presentation). We werent hungry for more but also wasnt completely full and wanted to extend our experience. We asked for a chefs surprise and they brought us three huge pieces of fatty salmon belly (something only offered on the tasting menu). It was really nice, definitely fatty (in a good way) and super generous portion. A great way to end the meal.I very much look forward to getting back to try more items and some of my favorites. The BYO is just icing on the cake (liquor store across the street) and the bill was remarkable ($35/person). The space is cool, intimate and fun with great food and value.

The hostess and staff immediately, loudly congratulated us upon walking in, as did one of the head chefs. Half way through the Omakase, he enquired about the meal, gave us his best wishes table side and even threw in free dessert!

I fear that it could jump the shark if it gets any more good reviews.  But, the Vizconde twins did not disappoint when I sat promptly at 5 p.m. in front of them at the sushi bar after not having eating a single thing all day in anticipation of my omakase experience.  They completely toppled my previous favorite, Coast.  Dear Coast, Ive already forgotten what you look like.  Just to give you a little perspective, I worked as a fine-dining server for 15 years in the best American and French restaurants.  I have a razor-tuned palate. When it comes to sushi, while I love it and have eaten at countless sushi bars, Im a bit out of my element. Ive  I dont know any Japanese terminology.  I only explain this to tell you that I do not lightly say this This was not only the best sushi Ive ever had.  It was the best meal Ive ever experienced in Chicago in terms of the entire experience .  .  . and the value for the dollar.  I know when restaurants are screwing you over for a tasting menu and this does not happen at Kai Zan.  Now I know that their prices have risen slightly since their opening, but what I received for $60 last night was spot on.  BTW, Dear General Public Do you know that whenever you eat out for brunch you are getting totally hosed on value for your dollar? Here the dollar sprouts little angel wings and flies further than you know it could in the overpriced universe known as Chicago.The food, everyone else on this forum has emphasized the food in great detail.  My favorite was the Angry Crab and the Scallop pearls with truffle oil.  The dashi broth course was also excellent.  And ending with the sashimi plate instead of starting with it .  .  . absolutely genius.  After already having had around 10 courses, you realize now matter how full you are you can slide down just one more perfectly cut piece of fish.  The Dynamite Mussel was also excellent, much more flavorful than the standard French presentation of mussels & frites.  I checked with the chef and, of course, even the mussels were sourced carefully, New Zealand  green lipped as Id suspected.  They are richer, slightly larger, fattier, and more flavorful than the standard PEI mussel that is generally served in restaurants.  If you ever have your choice at the fishmonger, buy them when you see them.  Prepare them as you normally would, but they will taste better. Sitting at the sushi bar was a great experience and the chefs made a couple extra items in addition to the standard menu that night and handed them directly to me.  I always sit at the sushi bar so I can ask chefs to prepare me something off the menu, but these guys did it without me even having asked.  That really sealed my imminent return.  I began to wonder at one point if they suspected me of being a food writer, because I just kind of look like one and if youve read this far, you really can tell that Im a writer, just not a food writer.  (Occasional psychology articles if youre interested.) One food critique that Im going to include, and only because I read many other reviews on here that mentioned it too, is the Tuna-tini.  Now, I think American brains get a bit confused some of the time because we always want our taste buds to be knocked out of the park, and an important element of Japanese cuisine is subtlety and simplicity, as in the dashi broth.  The Tuna-tini is a simple salad composed of Blue Fin toro, avocados, and heirloom tomatoes over a bed of seaweed.  The server described a dressing that was in it, but I didnt taste it.  There was nothing to highlight all of the flavors, Im really thinking this dish is calling out for a bit more acidity to cut the fatty tuna and avocado flavors and textures. Also, as much as I love the taste of Blue Fin toro, the entire world needs to stop eating it for a few years. Its clearly listed as a fish to be avoided by the Monterey Bay guide.  I had no problems with the service.  Many on this forum have complained of stoic or aloof service.  Dear General Populace, you are not at TGI Fridays.  The service needs to do their job not fulfill any inner-emotional vacuum that you might be having.  As long as servers make a suggestion or two, are knowledgeable about the food, are quick efficient, thats all you need.  Theyre not there to be your friend, they are doing their job.  Get over yourself.Obviously, I highly recommend you patronize this establishment.  It has a nice romantic atmosphere that is not trying to hard or overdone in anyway.  They serve alcohol but I was informed on the phone I could bring a bottle of wine or sake for a corkage fee of $15/two people.  A very reasonable corkage fee if Ive ever heard one.  I seized on the idea and brought a nice white wine to enjoy. My next big meal out is definitely going to be the elevated omakase, with my beautiful wife and a bottle of demi-sec champagne.  Wont that be a lovely evening?',6);

We spent $70, walked out of there still hungry! The experience was NOT a good one whatsoever! I probably would not have even written this review if it wasnt for the obnoxious, scam waitress and for her eagerness to get us out of there by 7 and suggesting all the most expensive items on the menu which we got very little considering the price!

I got a little bit of that vibe when we asked for our servers recommendations, but nothing so over the top that it spoiled our meal.',21);

We used it as an opportunity to choose a few extra items from the menu in lieu of cocktails. My choice was the unagi poppers that, although he waiter tried to persuade me against as not unique, I thoroughly enjoyed.A few general words about the menu.  Small and well chosen.  It is the size of an single sheet of paper offering a broad, but still select group of options.  It was nice to not have to wade through page after page of house specialties.What we both found unusual was the preparation of the rolls.  There seems to be a trend to over sauce to the point of losing the flavor of the fish in current soy/wasabi blends.  Not so here.  It has been a long time since I enjoyed such a great balance between the ingredients.  Very refreshing....and yes, the Escolar Pearls and Angry Crab are must tries.  All of our choices were both flavorful and delicate simultaneously though sometimes the construction required a light touch on the chopsticks lest your bite disassembles on its way to your mouth.  I had the mango pudding for dessert, also a winner.Prices are very reasonable though portions are just a bit on the small side.  It did allow for a nice sampling experience and now that I think back I would describe the meal as sushi meets tapas.  The two of us left fully satisfied for $75 (not including tip).The service was good with an exception of a miscalculation on our servers part at one point overwhelming our small table.  In a small sushi restaurant with a lot to sample, timing is everything.  I will go back to sample the great food  in one of the four cozy, enclosed dining booths on the left side of the restaurant. They looked like a great date/anniversary setting.',9);

When there is an option to let the chef feed you, do it.Hard to remember all the dishes, but the uni shooters were lovely- a teensy bit acidic for my taste, the bacon wrapped mushrooms were great, and the little mushroom soups were so aromatic and full of flavor. Just the broth was amazing. Obviously all the fish was perfect- they are a little heavy with the spices instead of leaving the fish in its natural state, but it worked, so I was okay with that.The space is so tiny, you have to make reservations or youll probably never get in. But its BYOB, which is really nice. Im a big fan of the BYOBs.

I have to say, Kai Zan is one of the amazing ones. The place is small, only has about 12 tables so a reservations is definitely recommended unless you want to wait. We arrived for our 545 reservation (I swear were not 95 years old, this is just all that was available) and were promptly seated. They had some very reasonably prices wines, which is definitely not something that you come across often at a good restaurant. We got the DMK rose and it was about $30 if I am not mistaken. The menu was a tad overwhelming so we had Justin do a run-through with us. We ended up doing one of the chefs omakase and then putting in a few additional dishes that we wanted to try -Tako Yaki (4 stars) this is basically fried octopus, and its amazing. A tad spicy, not for the faint of hear, but really delicious. Im not a huge fan of fried dishes, which is the only reason this is not getting 5 stars from me. But if you are, this is a must. -Escolar/Maguro Peals (5 stars) The fish was amazing. And the additional of the truffle oil really only made it better. These are small, like really small. But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in flavor. -Dynamite Mussels (4 stars) These were really great as well. I believe we were only served 2 mussels, so another small portion for the price, but amazing. --Uni/Oyster Shooters (5 stars) These were one of my favorite dishes of the night. If youre a fan of shooters, these are some of the best Ive ever had. The flavors were incredible, and they top them off with a bit of Tabasco, which, being from the South, really sealed the deal for me. -Madai Carpaccio (4 stars) As far as flavor goes, 5 stars, but a tiny tiny portion, so I left feeling a little disappointed in that area. But if my only complaint is that there wasnt enough of it, then were doing okay.-Angry Crab (5 stars) absolutely my favorite dish of the night. Although it was a very small portion, it was incredible. A must order.-Orange Rush (3 stars) this was similar to the angry crab, only this was made with salmon as opposed to tuna. The salmon had a pretty strong fish taste, so this was not my favorite dish, however my husband loved it.  -Fiesta Maki (4.5 stars) This was one of the two rolls we were served (6 large pieces). It was part of the omakase. To start, I dont even like cilantro in my sushi, but I loved this roll. The combination of the chili oil with the jalapeno was just great and I would definitely order again. If youre looking for a simple, fresh roll, give this a shot. -Flaming Tuna (5 stars) This was SO GOOD (8 smaller pieces). One of my favorite parts of the night. I only wish I had been hungrier, as this was the last dish brought to us. It was on the richer side, so different from the Fiesta, but it was delicious. A must order for me.

We were seated at the bar and in true Japanese tradition, it was cozy and occasionally kitchen-like in atmosphere. Thankfully, the service and food was similarly focused on quality. The fish was fresh for being in the midwest. There was a nice selection of shellfish too, so the omakase menu really took us through a variety of flavors and textures.Where to begin? The pork belly with rapini was delectable. I wanted more. A lot more. The grilled smelt (nicely paired with a mushroom dashi) was that hit of fishiness that I love. You gotta eat the whole thing thing, head to tail. The red snapper with basil and olive oil was a great shout out to italian raw preparation. The truffle tuna nigiri was a subtle use of a luxury (and overpowering) ingredient. Lastly, uni shooter. Yeah, oyster shooter too but uni is my sushi kryptonite. The only time I used the soy sauce was with the maki and sashimi courses, which tells you something about how well seasoned each plate was. In fact, I could go on and describe every course mouth-watering detail but Id like to end this review sometime in 2013. Maybe I couldve loved this more if we had unagi and mackerel (aka my other sushi kryptonites) but thats just me reaching for something negative to say. On the whole I was deeply impressed and satisfied with my meal. And so was my date.At one point, the tea kettle they were serving from broke and tea spilled all over the place. The staff couldnt have been nicer. Several members came up to see if we were okay. Everything landed on the table. No big whoop. They even offered to replace a possibly ruined plate. It wasnt. It was delicious. But it was very indicative of how they dealt with an emergency situation, which was with total professionalism. It made what was our holiday night out, special in an unexpected way.

Places like Japonais and Roka Akor get more buzz because of the chic decor and the River North location, but Kai Zan offers up similar food at similar quality, but at a slightly lower price point.  Add in that its BYOB and you can see why it gets the Yelp cred that it gets.  We were able to score a same night reservation around 7pm.  It sounds like they keep to a pretty tight schedule as we were informed we had a little over an hour to eat when we sat down.  That put us off a little right off the bat, but ultimately after that, they never really pushed the issue and we ate without feeling rushed or pressed.The menu is split into cold and hot appetizers, sushi and rolls, and a few choice robata style entrees, along with a nice selection of seasonal specials.  We got a pretty wide mix of everything, although we were tempted to just go with one of the omakase choices (next time!)We started with the angry crab roll and medium-thin sliced piece of maguro wrapped around a ball of fresh lump crab meat mixed with a spicy mayo and topped with pankos.  A solid mix and a good way to start the meal.  The tuna was more meaty and tender than fatty and melded nicely with the crab.As someone whos always on the lookout for good fried chicken, karaage is tough to pass up.  While good, the karaage was one of the more forgettable dishes of the meal.  A bit salty on the batter and a bit overcooked.The hamachi kama, taken from the neck/collar of the yellowtail, was the highlight of the meal.  The grilled char gave the cooked fish a nice smokey flavor and the fish itself had a nice meaty texture.  Cooked yellowtail is quite different from the raw hamachi most of us are used to and has a very fishy flavor, almost like mackerel.  The portion size was very generous for the price.  These apparently are in somewhat limited supply so if its in stock, I highly recommend grabbing one.Next up is the takoyaki - the skewer comes topped with just a touch of wasabi mayo, bonito flakes.  These little fried octopus balls were solid and the bonito flakes, the wasabi mayo, and the touch of teriyaki gave it a nice mix of sweet, salty, and spicy.Feeling like we had to sample a few things from every portion of the menu, we next ordered a few pieces from the grill. First,  the slightly fatty cut of pork belly, served with a small side of kimchi, and the second, a large prawn,which was just a bit undercooked but massive in size.To finish the meal off, we moved on to the raw fish portion of the meal.  The salmon was superbly fresh and well cut to a nice thickness, and the escolar simlarly so, although it lacked a bit of the usual crisp, moist bite that bursts when you bite into it.  We ended with a pair of raw ama ebi shrimps - fresh and sweet and followed by the meatiest, most flavorful shrimp heads Ive ever had.  These almost made the meal in itself.Thankfully, the meal didnt necessarily need the extra support from the shrimp heads.  Even before that, there was a number of dishes that put this meal into the upper echelon of Japanese meals Ive had in Chicago.  Id put the sushi just a step down from Katsu, but still better than 95% of the joints in Chicago.  And we cant wait to go back.Pics and more up at',18);

Also we enjoyed Otoro tartare over rice with a quail egg, wasabi, some truffle and three MONSTROUS Uni lobes.  Finally the fried Aji, a mild mackerel.  So cool.  They served about 6-8 slices of Sashimi from the Aji, inside of the Aji.  The fish itself was fried, but because it has soft bones (like a softshell crab?) you can eat the whole fish.  Ive had whole fish before, and I what they plate usually looks like in the end.  This was not that.  We were served a whole fish, and returned plates with no debris.  Awesome.We followed this with Omakase.  All I will say is that it feels to me like a steal.  At $60, you cant afford NOT to have it!  I would happily pay another 40-60 if Carlo and Melvin maybe added a Wagyu course, maybe used some fresh truffle instead of oil, I dont know.  I thought it was wonderful.After Omakase, we wanted to try some of the grilled skewers.  We were pretty filled up, but we had some time left on our table! Good thing we ordered quickly.  We tried the beef tongue, duck, pork belly shishito peppers.  The pepper were wonderful as well with ponzu (?) and bonito flakes.  We commented to our server that we felt the Uni was of an especially high quality and the kitchen sent for us the Escolar Pearls (oysters wrapped in escolar) each topped with another HUGE Uni lobe over a tobasco and ponzu foam as our final bite. THANKS CARLO AND MELVIN. A rich end to a rich meal.  All in all, we never felt rushed during the meal, loved everything we ate and look forward to bringing the rest of our friends back.  Everyone should hurry up and go before they get their Michelin star and Carlo and Melvin realize they are shortchanging themselves on price, because they are.',15);

A soft but flavorful fish with hints of cilantro.- Tuna and Escolar - Just some great pieces of sushi that have a little more fat than the previous fish.- Oyster and Scallop + Uni shooters - One of my favorite dishes of the night. Both were rather slimy as they were topped with an egg but the flavor was unbelievable. Some of the best oysters and uni Ive had.- Angry Crab - This is basically a crab roll wrapped in some delicious tuna. Just imagine the best crab roll youve had and know its better than that.- Tunatini - This was a rather disappointing dish. It was basically a sashimi salad but the ingredients didnt really work well together. But all the ingredients were all very fresh.- Tuna Dashi - Favorite dish #2. A small piece of tuna on a skewer is placed inside a mushroom dashi (soup) and while the tuna is still on par with all the other fish Ive been eating, the dashi was the star. The dashi was packed with flavor but it wasnt heavy. It was refreshing and clean and was one of the best soups Ive ever had.- Shrimp, Crab Cake, Pork Belly, Octopus - I thought these were the last 4 dishes of the night but instead, they ended up being one dish. My favorite part was the pork belly. Soft, perfectly spiced but with a crispy exterior. The worst part was the greens the pork belly was placed on. Way too salty. Also the octopus was slightly too tart for my liking.- Mussel - Honestly, I dont even remember it because it came with the previous dish.

It was packed full with juicy mushrooms and a strong taste of spices/herbs. It was so aromatic and I could have kept eating it because it didnt feel too heavy, either.

It was both light and not too oily, but also incredibly cozy. Its been a while since I found a restaurant in Chinatown that had the broth done so well, with strong (but not overpowering) medicinal qualities. Id come back every time for this broth!!My friends and I were blown away. The service was stellar -- every employee was very considerate and attentive to us despite having such a busy time evening. Im also a server who has worked in Chinatown before, and I have to give them a double thumbs up for how sweet they were.

The bacon wrapped dates have a very sweet date in the middle wrapped by strong, smoky bacon, all drenched in a juicy sauce. You can never have just one bite!

I was happy to see that Lil Babareeba prepared them just as deliciously as Café Babareeba does!From the brunch menu, we tried the avocado toast and the French toast. I was not expecting it, but this was some of the best avocado toast Ive ever had. It was so savory and filled with flavor, and each bite was a lovely medly of avocado, spices, and bacon. My friend and I had to make sure we split it in half because if we didnt, one of us would have eaten the others! The French toast, on the other hand, was a nice way to finish out the meal, but I could not think of anything particularly standout about it.Unfortunately, it was a bit difficult to check out at the end of the meal. We were unable to catch a servers attention at all, much less our own server, when we had already cleaned our plates and were raising our hand to check out. It seemed that no one was looking at us and had forgotten we were there; by the time another server came around and asked if we wanted the check, I was already a bit annoyed it had taken so long for them to even look at us.While I will always love Café Babareeba as the original, Lil Babareeba has also won a piece of my heart.

I had the chicken instead, and while the chicken was cooked well and I had enjoyed it, I couldnt help but wonder how this was different than eating any other rotisserie chicken. A gravy was given to me to pour over the meat, but the lack of vegetables on my plate of literally just chicken was rather disappointing when I looked at everyone else with a side of vegetables.I did, however, enjoy the free starters of bread and vegetables. Ive never had a restaurant give vegetable sticks and ranch as a starter, but I cant complain. I love a good celery stalk with ranch, and it definitely felt like necessary breaks in between the mouthfuls of meat. I was happy that they were generous in how large each vegetable stick was, too.I would recommend Keens to those who have never been here before and want to enjoy the famous mutton, but if youre like me and will be unable to, then you might be better off at another restaurant.',26);

This is definitely a good sign of a restaurant.Throughout the meal, I really appreciate how sweet every employee was. There definitely was a touch of "home" to the restaurant, as each employee who helped us was very cheerful and kind and patient. In NYC, this was something I was surprised by but very much happy to see. The cuisine itself is elevated Korean food, but the restaurant, service, and ambiance is still so nostalgic of my favorite hole-in-the-wall Korean restaurants run by families. I was very, very pleased and appreciative of the service we got even though they seemed to have a full house from opening.When it comes to the food, my favorite of what we ordered was the black sesame tofu. It was not too light and not too heavy, perfectly refreshing as a bite in between my bibimbap. The black sesame sauce was interesting, as Im used to sweetness when it comes to anything with black sesame. However, this one was very nutty and very strong in the sesame flavor. It was great as an appetizer and worked well as we made our way through our mains.The bibimbap itself felt a bit lacking as the flavors were not very standout. I remember feeling like it was on the bland side, but couldnt exactly pin down what flavors were missing. It wasnt the greatest that Ive had, but my friend really enjoyed his fried rice, so maybe I should order something different next time.I do recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a hearty Korean meal.

We made an effort to each order different items so that we could have a little taste of as many dishes as possible. I would say that by the end, we felt decently filled up without feeling like any courses were too heavy or too light.While the meal was delightful, it is hard for me to say if there was anything standout about the restaurant. Chicago is a city with more Italian restaurants than you could ever want, and I understand that its difficult to discern one from the other when you have so many options.

However, I have mixed feelings about the restaurant since I came a few times ago.Last year, I had come with my dad as a birthday celebration when he was visiting Chicago. We had included in our reservation that there was a birthday, and the host had very cheerfully wished us a happy birthday when we were seated. The food was the same delicious quality I remember and my dad was very pleased as well. At the end of the meal, our server came out with a tiramisu dessert with a candle and said that it was for the birthday. We were very excited and surprised, as tiramisu is one of my dads favorite desserts, and we enjoyed it happily. However, when the bill came, we noticed that the tiramisu was charged for. When we asked our server about it because we had not ordered it ourselves, he said that it was how they did birthdays - they choose a dessert for you and add a candle to it. That seemed rather strange to me. On birthdays, the restaurant doesnt ask if you want dessert, chooses a dessert for you, and then tells you to pay for it? What if a customer did not want a dessert or was allergic to one of the dessert options? This felt frustrating to us and we had voiced this to the server, but he said that it was just how things were done and we had accepted the tiramisu. Had we known that this was what was going to happen, we would not have accepted it - we were quite full already and werent planning on dessert, anyways. In order to not ruin a birthday dinner, I gave up my card and stopped trying to fight the bill. When our bill came back, it was a host who told us that they had removed the dessert but "wouldnt be able to next time". I knew then that next time, if I were to come, I wouldnt mention there was a birthday.I enjoy the food at Quartino and think they are very well priced for the authenticity and for the quantity. However, this experience was quite hard to forget as Ive never been treated like this at a restaurant, especially for a birthday celebration. If this is the restaurant policy, then all I can say is that if you come for a birthday, be prepared for a dessert to be forced upon you.',17);

It wasnt the best service I had ever received but I do believe it was the best that the team could have done, so hats off to their efforts.We had ordered courses for our meal and were actually slightly confused when our second course came out before the first. We shrugged it off, assuming that the kitchen was busy or something had just not been fired in order. Our server came back a few minutes later to apologize for the mistake, but we were flexible and didnt mind.I ordered the fish for my main entrée and was actually very pleased with its cooking.

We were seated quickly by the friendly host, but we instantly felt that service was lacking. We could tell how busy the restaurant was and how understaffed they were, but it felt like no one was even looking at us as we tried numerous times to get anyones attention to place our order. It took about 10 minutes after we were done looking at the menu for our server to come ask for what we wanted. When he came, we felt that he was impatient and slightly curt with us, as my friend (who was rather annoyed at this point that it took so long to order), said "Were actually ready to order now" and was responded with "Okay great, but how are you doing?" when it was obvious that he just wanted to place our order. That comment itself took us aback after the server left because it was not necessary at all, and instead of taking our order, the server seemed to ignore my friends statement. Im a server in Chicago for a few years now and I could sense that while our server was frustrated and was balancing many tables, he was giving my friend attitude like he was trying to match my friends tone. While it is a busy and packed restaurant, we would have appreciated if the server could have just taken our order without giving us additional attitude so it would have been easier for all of us.When our food came out, we were actually very pleased with the ricotta pillows. We had never had anything like it and very much enjoyed the pesto it came with. From the way service had started, the food almost made up for it.When the main courses came out, however, my friends pasta reached the table about 5 minutes before mine did. Its understandable that at a busy restaurant, they cant time that all the entrees come together, but we were rather confused because the runner who gave us the food did not mention whether my course would be coming out anytime soon. It felt rushed as it was dropped on our table without a mention, and my friend was very confused if he should start eating because he didnt want his food to grow cold but also did not want to start too early if mine was close by. He ended up starting his own meal, and was nearly finished by the time our server came around again and told me that mine was on the way. By the time I got mine, he was done.At the end of the meal when we checked out, our server stopped by and said he appreciated our patience. We responded similarly, but the start of service left a bad taste in my mouth. I understand how stressful and difficult it could be to be handling many tables at the same time on an understaffed evening, but there are small things here and there that can be done to ensure that a customers experience is not negative. It was okay if we did not receive their top service, but this felt like service that was below average. We talked about it at the end of the meal and mentioned that we knew our server tried to handle things professionally, but it was obvious that the stress was getting to him and he had then displayed it to customers.Im a server as well in this industry, and I sympathize with our servers situation. While it was not a great experience, I think this reflects more on the shape of the industry as a whole. Management needs to take steps to make sure staff do not feel overworked and that they minimize the risk of this kind of dining experience, while also training staff to handle pressure well. If they cant handle a full house, then they shouldnt offer a full house.Overall, the food was delicious and I quite enjoyed the cooking.

I like how healthy and transparent the ingredients are, and how on each bag, they include a note about their charity work. Unlike other salad places, I like how every bowl is on the simpler side so their price can reflect it, but its still delicious. It goes to prove that yummy meals dont need to come at complicated ingredients.My current favorite is the buffalo cauliflower bowl. I dont need to add anything extra to the bowl to enjoy it, and sometimes order an additional bit of pineapple to add some sweetness. I like how their buffalo cauliflower does not imitate meat; instead, you can tell that you are eating cauliflower and are enjoying the taste of cauliflower that has been prepared in a batter similar to that of meat. Furthermore, I usually feel full for lunch with a small bowl; for dinner (or when I have a bigger appetite), I might opt for the large bowl.Another favorite of mine is surprisingly the sesame sauce in their Asian sesame bowl. I feel like most of these kinds of sauces taste similar, but I remember that the first time I tried their dressing, I was instantly blown away and loved the taste of it. There were strong notes of sesame that worked well with the sharpness of the sauce. Sometimes I get this bowl just for the sauce!',23);

I was very pleased with each dish I had ordered. My second favorite was the duck - I usually do not enjoy duck cooked medium, but this was one very well cooked. Instead of the usual gamey taste that makes me stay away from duck, I did not taste it at all in this dish. I enjoy the various preparations of the duck that I had on one plate, and each had a unique taste and flavor. For the first time, I might say that I would order the duck again.My favorite, as usual, was the dessert. I had gotten the candy bar dessert as recommended by the server, and I was very happy that I did. Cutting into the bar, you can notice distinct layers with a caramel filling slowly oozing out. I enjoyed the soft chocolate crumble, the mousse-like texture, and the thin chocolate shell. The sprinkle of salt at the top really brought it all together.My biggest compliment to the restaurant, however, would be the plating.

When we arrived to the location, we noticed that it was rather small inside. In the midst of the pandemic, it felt like you could only comfortably fit one party inside at a time. Therefore, most people were waiting outside for their orders. I chose to get fresh milk without tea for my beverage, and I kind of regret it. It was much too sweet without the tea, but it was still the classic Tiger Sugar aesthetic that has gone viral recently. The boba was warm and you could tell they had just pulled it out from cooking, which I did appreciate knowing. However, like a few other reviews wrote, the boba was a bit more firm than I would have expected. It felt like it wasnt cooked long enough but it was a bit inconsistent, too. Overall, I think its a good place to try if youve never had Tiger Sugar before. Otherwise I would have recommended going to a different boba place -- the name carries the hype at this location more than the taste and price.',9);

The frosting flavors (ube, mango, and green tea) were not too strong but not too subtle either, and were sweet enough that we could enjoy them without feeling like we were getting cavities (as I normally do with donuts). I loved that we were able to watch the employees dip each donut by hand into the frosting as we were waiting for our order!The dough is something else. I love how chewy it was, and you could definitely tell the mochi flour adds an extra bounce. I like the shape of the donut that made it easy to pull apart and enjoy bite by bite without getting the hands too messy. It took less than a few minutes for our order to be ready since we ordered it, and so we were in and out in no time. Everything still tasted fresh, so it was obvious that the donuts hadnt just been sitting in cases for the whole day. We really appreciated how fast the service was for such an amazing treat here in SoCal!',9);

I stumbled upon Sugargoat looking for a quick treat to grab for some coworkers before heading to work, and knowing that ice cream wasnt the best idea, baked goods seemed like the solution.Since then, I come to Sugargoat regularly if I ever need to pick up treats! The shop is cozy and small, exactly from a childs storybook of what a color bakery could look like. It felt like you were walking into a fun, vibrant world contained within a small space, but there was so much to see with the eyes.In front, there were racks of baked goods. While the rainbow cupcakes were absolutely the spotlight, everything else couldnt be ignored. The cakes, cookies, coffee, and beautifully frosted desserts were so difficult to choose from. On the right, an ice cream freezer was stocked full of goodies, too. It felt like I could have stared at every flavor there was and not been tired!I ended up getting a Cheez-it cupcake for my coworker, which sounded like the classic Goat spin of whacky and whimsical into delicious bites. I was helped by very helpful and cheerful employees who were patient in explaining each item to me, and what the flavors were. By the time I left, there was a small line growing outside. Hard to stay away from this place!Definitely make sure to grab a quick treat here if you have the chance. For the size and flavors of the cupcakes, there isnt a $5 better spent anywhere else in the city.',29);

When I came to the Haven City Market with a friend, we decided to split a bowl. Why not?I was in shock when they were stacking the Acai bowl. The poor little bowl couldnt fit everything that the employee was stacking! There was just mountains on mountains of delicious, healthy nutrients in our bowl, it would be impossible to say it wasnt worth the price. I would definitely recommend getting the DIY option. There was not as much variety as other places might have, but this was decent for its location in a food court. Our employee did not shy away from placing absolute mountains of each topping on our bowl.

When we went on a weekday brunchtime, there were still available tables and nothing felt rushed. The server was pleasant with us, and we got ourselves a nice booth next to the window. Unlike other Goat restaurants, this one felt much more "casual". Of course, its a diner! I enjoy that they served classic diner favorites with the Izard spin to them, making it a comfortable familiarity to many of us. Los Drowned -- I normally wouldnt get a sandwich at a diner, but I decided to go for this by the recommendation of the server. The sandwich was massive and I have no idea how anyone could fit it in their mouth, so I took it apart and ate it piece by piece (as assembled as I could manage). Every flavor was delicious, but I felt that it lacked the signature combinations of wacky and wonderful Ive come to love about Goat. This Little Piggy Went to China -- Ive always appreciated how Goat restaurants try to work in unique ingredients that bring strong kicks of flavor, and this did not disappoint. On the menu, the list of ingredients would raise some eyebrows, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well everything went together. It felt a bit on the heavier side as well, but thats diner food for you, right?At the end of our meal, we went to the photo booth near the doorway. We received two photo strips from our few minutes inside and loved that the Little Goat Diner logo was there at the bottom of each. :)',12);

I know that at other tapas places in Chicago I could have walked away feeling more stuffed on the same price, but I know the pricing behind tasting menus is that they bring you their best dishes that when combined, comes to a price slightly higher than the packaged deal. That only made me wonder if the plates were just smaller and thats why I didnt feel so satisfied. Everything tasted amazing. It was the first time I had done a tapas tasting menu and I appreciated the variety that we had, including the dessert. For $55, we were able to get a healthy mix of proteins and mains, as well as appetizers. It was a bit disappointing that the largest, most filling plate was the potatoes. They were delicious, but noticeably a larger portion than everything else. Most everything else was finished within 2-3 bites, leaving much to be wanted. Our server was helpful to explain everything that we were eating. We were surprised at how quickly the food came out, one after the other. We didnt feel rushed and felt like we were able to enjoy everything that we were given but maybe would have preferred a bit more breathing room between each of them. Our server felt a bit awkward at times when there were silences as he hung over my friend and I before realizing we were doing okay and did not currently need help.Otherwise, we were seated at a lovely table next to a window overlooking Michigan Avenue. The location is in a nice hotel and is elevated on the second floor, meaning that we were able to enjoy some people watching. Overall, I would bring a friend here again if they were visiting Chicago but might choose a different tapas restaurant if I were going out with locals.',8);

Its the exact same menu at the Chinatown and Streeterville locations, but this one always gets me seated immediately. Such a hidden gem down in South Loop!! It deserves so much more attention compared to its Chinatown branch -- its literally 1 CTA stop away, too. Dim sum in Chicago has never been cheap, but Ive found MingHin to be the most reasonable. Its great that I can get dim sum during any time of the day, even late in to the evening. The flavors are authentic, and theres an amazing selection of sweet, savory, traditional classics, and new favorites.You order on tablets that the restaurant gives, which in my opinion, is super smart for customers. You can take all the time you need to decide with your party what you want to eat without feeling like a server is hovering over you, annoyed that you and your party havent been able to decide if youd have enough stomach space for one more dish. Its also super convenient that they have pricing "tiers" so that depending on the "tier/size" of your dimsum plate, its a fixed price. Makes it so much easier to plan what to eat on whatever budget!Aside from the dim sum, the rest of the food here is authentic as well. I was pleasantly surprised, expecting that this location would not be as authentic because of where it is. Im glad to see that the same quality and tastes from Chinatown could be found in South Loop!Make sure to leave stomach for dessert. The complimentary almond cookies and fortune cookie goes well when washed down with hot tea.',18);

Im always so stuffed that Im bewildered how I used to go to IHOPs. Theres no reservations and the line can be seen snaking around the corner on weekends. I like to go on weekdays instead to keep my fingers crossed that I can get in within 30 minutes. Its a fairly large restaurant, but its always packed! The location is prime in Chicago, so even if you have to wait a while, you can take a nice stroll at the park next door. I like to always order the egg menu items that come with a side of pancakes, and then upgrade the pancakes to specialty pancakes. Trust me, this is more than enough food for one individual already and the value is out-of-this-world, but my hungry mouth always waters when I read what they offer so I can never order without the pancakes side. Theres usually more than enough food to bring home and heat up another day. As most restaurant are though, the pancakes dont heat up so well at home, so I would try to finish it at the restaurant.

Theres usually already a small group forming near the door at lunchtime, so it seemed that many others had the same ideas. Ive never needed to wait past an hour for a table, but when your stomach is hungry, carbs cant come any faster. The rice cakes tend to be a bit sweeter than Ive found other places to be, and while I usually do enjoy a bit of sugar in my meal, its a bit more than I like.

We usually can split one roll between two people, and its all for ~$6. Our favorites are the beef and fishcake rolls! The pickled daikon is always so flavorful but not too sour as you might find in store-bought varieties.Other favorites Ive had from this restaurant are the multicolored Korean rice desserts that they have on the center island of the store.

These go bad within a day or two of being left in the fridge but is so great fresh.The fridges are stocked with Korean side dishes that my family likes to buy to accompany a dinner at home. Kimchi can be bought in small jars, or in massive bags. You can really tell that everything is homemade because of its packaging, and you wont ever need to worry about how fresh it all is.

Positives first, this Airbnb has all of the listed essentials and more complimentary items than expected that my group very much enjoyed! There were lots of complimentary snacks (crackers, fruits snacks, chips), drinks (sodas, water, coffee, etc), and a nice movie selection in the living room. The restroom was also stocked with shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, shower cap, and more. Lulu, the host helping us out during our stay, was responsive and very nice. The hosts did a great job providing everything needed in the home and also checked in through Airbnb messenger with our group for any questions, issues, or concerns. Pertaining to the location, there is a reason that the hosts mention safety in the listing and urged potential guests to research the area prior to booking. Though my group did research the area and was informed of the South Side location, I dont think we were prepared for all of the activities that occurred at our Airbnb during our stay. As soon as we got to the apartment, activities occurred that put us a little on edge and made us extremely cautious during our stay. On the first night when we arrived at approximately 10PM, pulling up to the Airbnb, we saw a group of people a few buildings down from our Airbnb, gathered in a circle, and burning something in the streets. Twenty minutes or so into settling down in the apartment, we heard shouting from outside of the apartment and realized that a group of people were right in front of our Airbnb fighting. This fight was extremely disruptive, loud, and scary. Sunday night, there was a group of people standing in the street near our Airbnb, staring at my friends and I as soon as we got out of our Uber. My group was triggered having seen what happened the first night and asked the Uber to drop us off closer to our Airbnb gate. Before checking out on the third day, we also heard something that sounded like a gunshot in the morning. None of these activities are common where my friends and I live and weve never had an experience quite like this one anywhere else. The only day that nothing strange happened and the neighborhood was quiet was on the second night. Many of the Uber/Lyft drivers that picked us up/dropped us off also made concerning comments to us and warned us to be careful during our stay in the neighborhood. I now understand why this Airbnb has high ratings in every category except for location and had mixed commentary about the location in the reviews (some people mentioned the neighborhood is peaceful vs. others saying its crime infested). Its unpredictable what type of experience you are going to have because it really depends on what days you stay and whats happening in the neighborhood on those days, but the host did apologize and mention to us that the activities we experienced were rare, and happen infrequently. With all that said, be mindful when you book and know what you might be getting yourself into if you happen to come on one of the days the occasional events occur.',97);

This huge apartment, with well-maintained and clean wooden floor, a full-sized gas stove, fridge, utensils, TVs, etc., has more than enough to space to hold a party (now, dont get ideas, because we wouldnt want this quaint  home to be trashed). Ibi and Cole even leaves snacks to munch on.   The U of Chicago campus and Hyde Park area is just a 10-15 min drive across the freeway.  We visited the campus too.  Beautiful.  I have to mention the Goree cuisine (Senegalese) restaurant (1126 E. 47th St Chicago).  Exquisite food at a very reasonable price and one of our highlights in this week-long Midwest trip.  Close to Peoria St, on 71st, I will also recommend the Rehmania, a hole-in-the-wall take out that serves good food cheap and aplenty. My son traveled with us for the first night and he took the over-sized couch for that night. We stayed mostly out as we had only two days to visit this historic city.  We drove back late at night (10 min drive from downtown during low traffic) and never felt unsafe.  Everybody parks on the street and we easily parked our rental car right in front of the house.  We drove around the neighborhood to take in the real Chicago.  We enjoyed that at least as much as we enjoyed the dressed up downtown Chicago. There were real people at street corners, at the WholeFoods, at coffee shops and at the gas stations.  I wish we had a week, but that will have to wait till after retirement.   This accommodation was much more than what we expected.  Reading a previous review about it (after I had booked) I will lie if I said I had no concerns, especially with the reputation that the Southside of that city has (thanks to the media).  I have to say that we were blown away by the hospitality and the general friendliness of people in that area.  No doubt that it is a depressed part of the city, but we noticed relentless community policing all time of the day. There is even regular street cleanings on Tuesdays in that neighborhood.  While the glitzy downtown receives all the attention from Mr. Emmanuel and his city council, Englewood has heart.',23);

The larger room is nice for spreading out a little and having more space to move around in.  The bed is comfy and there is dresser space for getting your clothing out of your suitcase and hangers and hooks for hanging. It does have a steam heat radiator that is on its own schedule so it can get very hot in there but thankfully the windows open smoothly to help cool it off.  The bathroom facilities are just what I needed and the kitchen access is a very nice plus. There was one very cold morning with no hot water and no heat which made for a bad start to the day.

Most everything was very clean, but I did find a bug on the wall one night. I had the privilege of sleeping in both rooms of the apartment. The room with the loft is larger, but be wary of the loft temperature - it was a hot summer week when I was there and the loft area was around 20 degrees warmer than the floor with AC on full, which for me was extremely uncomfortable, especially because memory foam absorbs heat. I had to convert the couch into a bed and sleep on that the first night. The loft is also pretty unforgiving - rough wood and visible screws at the corners - so make sure you can always see where you re going. The other room had a larger bed, but as a 6 1   man, I couldn t lay all the way flat even diagonally without my feet up against the wall. Both mattresses are very comfortable and the sheets were very clean. Luiz s friend Tony was a gem when helping with check-in.

The room is a standard small room for NY but it felt so much bigger because the bed was not in the way. Since it is raised above, there was more space to maneuver and relax! I loved this feature the most because I could set up my laptop station at the sofa area under the bed which had a height clearance of probably 6  (maybe less)? I m 5 3 so I was able to walk under the bunk area just fine.Getting to the bed area was fine for me, but you will have to be very careful in watching where you step. There s not much to hold on to except for the railing of the bunk ladder and the side of the bed. Once there though, it is fantastic. The mattress was soft yet firm enough to offer plenty of back support. The sheets were soft and clean. There s a lamp next to the mattress for added light in the dark. Then the best part is the tv that is stationed right in front of you with so many channels to choose from a Roku system that is connected to the apartment s Netflix account (and a few others too).Your sleep will be sound here! Of all the nights I stayed here in this room, I barely heard any outside noise! Usually the nightlife of NY is loud, especially in the bustling streets of Times Square! So I was rather surprised how quiet it was here despite the fantastic location. I think it was that the room s window was turned away from the streets, and the room is on the second floor of the building.For those who make bathroom visits in the middle of the night, it may be a bit inconvenient as the toilet is actually outside the apartment in the hallway behind a locked door. So you ll have to climb down the bunkbed, remember to grab the keys, put shoes on, go out of the apartment and down the hall, and unlock the door to the toilet room. This didn t bother me much though, considering how lovely the rest of the stay is.Right outside the apartment are so many convenient shops and lots of restaurants to choose from. I defaulted to the korean fried chicken joint during nights when I was too lazy to go on food adventures after a long day out. A couple blocks from Port Authority, this place was so easy to find when coming in from the airport. The reason of my stay here was for a convention at Javits so this place was the perfect location as it was a mere few blocks away from the convention center as well.I definitely recommend staying here if you can.

I just sent a friend a link to this page because I recommended this place to him and now he wants to stay here too.  The location was within a 15 minute walk of every Broadway show I booked. The price is amazing (about 1/3 of what my friend paid at a hotel one block away).  I didn t meet Luiz, but his place was clean and comfortable. I did meet Marcio who showed me around and was very helpful. I wish I had asked all my questions while Marcio was there (I had a little trouble finding towels, shampoo, where to take the trash out once I was on my own). I believe usually Luiz would be very easy to reach, but he had an illness while I was a guest so I didn t get all my questions answered as quickly as I would have if he had been well.  Now I ll be mentioning some things that I didn t mind, but I feel if I had certain friends with me--they wouldn t have liked these elements. I thought it gave me a real experience of NYC as a local. I wasn t sheltered from the real NYC in a touristy hotel.  1) Twice in the mornings, I had to knock on the front door of the building from the inside to get out because of inebriated gentlemen sitting on the steps. They were kind men who moved when I knocked, but I could see how some might find this disconcerting.  2) There is construction right outside the windows of the larger bedroom ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) . Construction is supposed to happen 8a-4p, but it started earlier while I was there. I didn t mind as I m an early riser but some people might.  3) The bathing room is tiny and right off the kitchen. If you re inside it with the door shut, it s a bit challenging to robe/disrobe and the water temperature wasn t consistent in the mornings (when I assume the other residents are also showering).  AirBnB commercials aren t kidding when they say you ll live like a local. I loved it.  If Luiz is open to it, I d be interesting in renting both bedrooms next time. I d have a friend stay with me and it wouldn t be as awkward to use the bathing room. I could walk from my bedroom to the bathing room in a towel or underwear and not have to change in the cramped space of the bathing room. Walking from room to room in a towel/underwear can be awkward if you don t know the person staying in the other bedroom.  I don t find the above things negative, but I think those who might find them negative would want to know about them.  Luiz was generous and kind when I asked to check out later. It worked out that he didn t have another renter right away. Thanks, Luiz, for making your place available. I enjoyed staying there and hope to again.',3);

As for the apartment it was basic but thats all you need as you are mostly exploring the city till late. I only slept in the apartment so all i needed was a bed. The room itself was good sized came with a sofa, drawers and a loft bed which i haven t slept on one of those since i was like 10 years old. There was a tv on the wall above the bed. The only weird thing was that the toilet was on the corridor but it is only used by that apartment so was fine. The bathroom was small aswell but i got used to it. The area itself was great. My fear were that i would not be safe walking the streets at night but was ok nobody bothered you and everyone was friendly and willing to help. Location wise it was perfect, Empire state building was about a 20 minute walk, Times Square about the same and Central Park about 30 mins with a short 10-15 minute subway ride to Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Centre.
