## Description
Most of the travel websites focus on search, price comparison, or comments. The information they provided is locations based rather than users based. Users will spend some time to find out what restaurants, tourist spots, or accommodations really suit their budget or preference. Our project aims to provide a simple, more user-relevant, painless information searching solution for travelers.

We will focus on building a database containing real-world data, including basic information for restaurants, tourist spots, and accommodations. The database will also include data revealing preferences such as reviews, scoring, or visiting information. The data sources of the database will be web scraping data or open-source data sets from famous platforms, such as Yelp, Airbnb, etc. With a massive amount of data, we aim to build our searching sites and recommender systems. As for user data, we will create a mock database that contains individual information, behaviors, and opinions. Finally, we will use the mock data to test our travel information searching system.
